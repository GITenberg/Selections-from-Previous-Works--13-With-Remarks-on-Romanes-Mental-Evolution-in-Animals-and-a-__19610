<h2><!-- page iii--><a name="pageiii"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>I delayed these pages some weeks in order to give Mr. Romanes 
an opportunity of explaining his statement that Canon Kingsley 
wrote about instinct and inherited memory in <i>Nature</i>, Jan. 
18, 1867. <a name="citationiii"></a><a href="#footnoteiii" 
class="citation">[iii]</a>&nbsp; I wrote to the 
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> (Jan. 26, 1884) and pointed out that 
<i>Nature</i> did not begin to appear till nearly three years 
after the date given by Mr. Romanes, and that there was nothing 
from Canon Kingsley on the subject of instinct and inherited 
memory in any number of <i>Nature</i> up to the date of Canon 
Kingsley&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; I also asked for the correct 
reference.</p>
<p>This Mr. Romanes has not thought it incumbent upon him to 
give.&nbsp; I am told I ought not to have expected him to give 
it, inasmuch as it is no longer usual for men of any but the 
lowest scientific standing to correct their misstatements when 
they are brought to book.&nbsp; Science is made for Fellows of 
the Royal Society, and for no one else, not Fellows of the Royal 
Society for science; and if the having achieved a certain 
position should still involve being obliged to be as scrupulous 
and accurate as other people, what is the good of the 
position?&nbsp; This view of the matter is practical, but I <!-- 
page iv--><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
iv</span>regret that Mr. Romanes should have taken it, for his 
having done so has prevented my being able to tell the reader 
what Canon Kingsley said about memory and instinct, and this he 
might have been glad to know.</p>
<p>I suspect, however, that what Canon Kingsley said was after 
all not very important.&nbsp; If it had been, Mr. Romanes would 
have probably told us what it was in his own book.&nbsp; I should
think it possible that Mr. Romanes&mdash;not finding Canon 
Kingsley&rsquo;s words important enough to be quoted, or even 
referred to correctly, or never having seen them himself and not 
knowing exactly what they were, yet being anxious to give every 
one, and more particularly Canon Kingsley, his due&mdash;felt 
that this was an occasion on which he might fairly take advantage
of his position and say at large whatever he was in the humour 
for saying at the moment.</p>
<p>I should not have thought this possible if I had not ere now 
had reason to set Mr. Romanes down as one who was not likely to 
be squeamish about trifles.&nbsp; Nevertheless, on this present 
occasion I certainly did think that he had only made a slip such 
as we all make sometimes, and such as he would gladly take the 
earliest opportunity to correct.&nbsp; As it is, I do not know 
what to think, except that D.C.L.&rsquo;s and F.R.S.&rsquo;s seem
to be made of much the same frail materials as we ordinary 
mortals are.</p>
<p>As regards the extracts from my previous books given in this 
volume, I should say that I have revised and corrected the 
original text throughout, and introduced <!-- page v--><a 
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>a sentence or 
two here and there, but have nowhere made any important 
alteration.&nbsp; I regret greatly that want of space has 
prevented me from being able to give the chapters from Life and 
Habit on &ldquo;The Abeyance of Memory,&rdquo; and &ldquo;What we
should expect to find if Differentiations of Structure and 
Instinct are mainly due to Memory;&rdquo; it is in these chapters
that an explanation of many phenomena is given, of which, so far 
as I know, no explanation of any kind had been previously 
attempted, and in which phenomena having apparently so little 
connection as the sterility of hybrids, the principle underlying 
longevity, the resumption of feral characteristics, the sterility
of many animals under confinement, are not only made intelligible
but are shown to be all part and parcel of the same 
story&mdash;all being explicable as soon as Memory is made the 
main factor of heredity.</p>

1</span>SELECTIONS FROM EREWHON. <a name="citation1"></a><a 
href="#footnote1" class="citation">[1]</a></h2>
<h3><i>CURRENT OPINIONS</i>.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">chapter 
x. of erewhon</span>.)</h3>
<p>This is what I gathered.&nbsp; That in that country if a man 
falls into ill health, or catches any disorder, or fails bodily 
in any way before he is seventy years old, he is tried before a 
jury of his countrymen, and if convicted is held up to public 
scorn and sentenced more or less severely as the case may 
be.&nbsp; There are subdivisions of illnesses into crimes and 
misdemeanours as with offences amongst ourselves&mdash;a man 
being punished very heavily for serious illness, while failure of
eyes or hearing in one over sixty-five who has had good health 
hitherto is dealt with by fine only, or imprisonment in default 
of payment.</p>
<p>But if a man forges a cheque, sets his house on fire, robs 
with violence from the person, or does any other such things as 
are criminal in our own country, he is either taken to a hospital
and most carefully tended at the public expense, or if he is in 
good circumstances, he lets it be known to all his friends that 
he is suffering from a severe fit of immorality, just as we do 
when we are ill, and they come and visit him with great 
solicitude, and inquire with interest how it all came about, <!--
page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
2</span>what symptoms first showed themselves, and so 
forth,&mdash;questions which he will answer with perfect 
unreserve; for bad conduct, though considered no less deplorable 
than illness with ourselves, and as unquestionably indicating 
something wrong with the individual who misbehaves, is 
nevertheless held to be the result of either pre-natal or 
post-natal misfortune.&nbsp; I should add that under certain 
circumstances poverty and ill luck are also considered 
criminal.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there exists a class of men trained in 
soul-craft, whom they call straighteners, as nearly as I can 
translate a word which literally means &ldquo;one who bendeth 
back the crooked.&rdquo;&nbsp; These men practise much as medical
men in England, and receive a quasi-surreptitious fee on every 
visit.&nbsp; They are treated with the same unreserve and obeyed 
just as readily as our own doctors&mdash;that is to say, on the 
whole sufficiently&mdash;because people know that it is their 
interest to get well as soon as they can, and that they will not 
be scouted as they would be if their bodies were out of order, 
even though they may have to undergo a very painful course of 
treatment.</p>
<p>When I say that they will not be scouted, I do not mean that 
an Erewhonian offender will suffer no social inconvenience.&nbsp;
Friends will fall away from him because of his being less 
pleasant company, just as we ourselves are disclined to make 
companions of those who are either poor or poorly.&nbsp; No one 
with a due sense of self-respect will place himself on an 
equality in the matter of affection with those who are less lucky
than himself in birth, health, money, good looks, capacity, or 
anything else.&nbsp; Indeed, that dislike and even disgust should
be felt by the fortunate for the unfortunate, or at any rate for 
those who have been <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>discovered to have met with any of the
more serious and less familiar misfortunes, is not only natural, 
but desirable for any society, whether of man or brute; what 
progress either of body or soul had been otherwise 
possible?&nbsp; The fact therefore that the Erewhonians attach 
none of that guilt to crime which they do to physical ailments, 
does not prevent the more selfish among them from neglecting a 
friend who has robbed a bank, for instance, till he has fully 
recovered; but it does prevent them from even thinking of 
treating criminals with that contemptuous tone which would seem 
to say, &ldquo;I, if I were you, should be a better man than you 
are,&rdquo; a tone which is held quite reasonable in regard to 
physical ailment.</p>
<p>Hence, though they conceal ill health by every kind of 
cunning, they are quite open about even the most flagrant mental 
diseases, should they happen to exist, which to do the people 
justice is not often.&nbsp; Indeed, there are some who, so to 
speak, are spiritual valetudinarians, and who make themselves 
exceedingly ridiculous by their nervous supposition that they are
wicked, while they are very tolerable people all the time.&nbsp; 
This however is exceptional; and on the whole they use much the 
same reserve or unreserve about the state of their moral welfare 
as we do about our health.</p>
<p>It has followed that all the ordinary greetings among 
ourselves, such as, How do you do? and the like, are considered 
signs of gross ill-breeding; nor do the politer classes tolerate 
even such a common complimentary remark as telling a man that he 
was looking well.&nbsp; They salute each other with, &ldquo;I 
hope you are good this morning;&rdquo; or &ldquo;I hope you have 
recovered from the snappishness from which you were suffering 
when I last saw you;&rdquo; and if the person <!-- page 4--><a 
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>saluted has not
been good, or is still snappish, he says so, and is condoled with
accordingly.&nbsp; Nay, the straighteners have gone so far as to 
give names from the hypothetical language (as taught at the 
Colleges of Unreason) to all known forms of mental indisposition,
and have classified them according to a system of their own, 
which, though I could not understand it, seemed to work well in 
practice, for they are always able to tell a man what is the 
matter with him as soon as they have heard his story, and their 
familiarity with the long names assures him that they thoroughly 
understand his case.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>We in England rarely shrink from telling our doctor what is 
the matter with us merely through the fear that he will hurt 
us.&nbsp; We let him do his worst upon us, and stand it without a
murmur, because we are not scouted for being ill, and because we 
know the doctor is doing his best to cure us, and can judge of 
our case better than we can; but we should conceal all illness if
we were treated as the Erewhonians are when they have anything 
the matter with them; we should do as we do with our moral and 
intellectual diseases,&mdash;we should feign health with the most
consummate art, till we were found out, and should hate a single 
flogging given by way of mere punishment more than the amputation
of a limb, if it were kindly and courteously performed from a 
wish to help us out of our difficulty, and with the full 
consciousness on the part of the doctor that it was only by an 
accident of constitution that he was not in the like plight 
himself.&nbsp; So the Erewhonians take a flogging once a week, 
and a diet of bread and water for two or three months together, 
whenever their straightener recommends it.</p>
<p><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
5</span>I do not suppose that even my host, on having swindled a 
confiding widow out of the whole of her property, was put to more
actual suffering than a man will readily undergo at the hands of 
an English doctor.&nbsp; And yet he must have had a very bad time
of it.&nbsp; The sounds I heard were sufficient to show that his 
pain was exquisite, but he never shrank from undergoing it.&nbsp;
He was quite sure that it did him good; and I think he was 
right.&nbsp; I cannot believe that that man will ever embezzle 
money again.&nbsp; He may&mdash;but it will be a long time before
he does so.</p>
<p>During my confinement in prison, and on my journey, I had 
discovered much of the above; but it still seemed new and 
strange, and I was in constant fear of committing some rudeness 
from my inability to look at things from the same stand-point as 
my neighbours; but after a few weeks&rsquo; stay with the 
Nosnibors I got to understand things better, especially on having
heard all about my host&rsquo;s illness, of which he told me 
fully and repeatedly.</p>
<p>It seemed he had been on the Stock Exchange of the city for 
many years and had amassed enormous wealth, without exceeding the
limits of what was generally considered justifiable or at any 
rate permissible dealing; but at length on several occasions he 
had become aware of a desire to make money by fraudulent 
representations, and had actually dealt with two or three sums in
a way which had made him rather uncomfortable.&nbsp; He had 
unfortunately made light of it and pooh-poohed the ailment, until
circumstances eventually presented themselves which enabled him 
to cheat upon a very considerable scale;&mdash;he told me what 
they were, and they were about as bad as anything could be, but I
need not detail them;&mdash;he <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>seized the 
opportunity, and became aware when it was too late that he must 
be seriously out of order.&nbsp; He had neglected himself too 
long.</p>
<p>He drove home at once, broke the news to his wife and 
daughters as gently as he could, and sent off for one of the most
celebrated straighteners of the kingdom to a consultation with 
the family practitioner, for the case was plainly serious.&nbsp; 
On the arrival of the straightener he told his story, and 
expressed his fear that his morals must be permanently 
impaired.</p>
<p>The eminent man reassured him with a few cheering words, and 
then proceeded to make a more careful diagnosis of the 
case.&nbsp; He inquired concerning Mr. Nosnibor&rsquo;s 
parents&mdash;had their moral health been good?&nbsp; He was 
answered that there had not been anything seriously amiss with 
them, but that his maternal grandfather, whom he was supposed to 
resemble somewhat in person, had been a consummate scoundrel and 
had ended his days in a hospital,&mdash;while a brother of his 
father&rsquo;s, after having led a most flagitious life for many 
years, had been at last cured by a philosopher of a new school, 
which as far as I could understand it bore much the same relation
to the old as hom&oelig;opathy to allopathy.&nbsp; The 
straightener shook his head at this, and laughingly replied that 
the cure must have been due to nature.&nbsp; After a few more 
questions he wrote a prescription and departed.</p>
<p>I saw the prescription.&nbsp; It ordered a fine to the State 
of double the money embezzled; no food but bread and milk for six
months, and a severe flogging once a month for twelve.&nbsp; He 
had received his eleventh flogging on the day of my 
arrival.&nbsp; I saw him later on the same afternoon, and he was 
still twinged; but even though he had been minded to do so (which
he <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
7</span>showed no sign of being), there would have been no escape
from following out the straightener&rsquo;s prescription, for the
so-called sanitary laws of Erewhon are very rigorous, and unless 
the straightener was satisfied that his orders had been obeyed, 
the patient would have been taken to a hospital (as the poor 
are), and would have been much worse off.&nbsp; Such at least is 
the law, but it is never necessary to enforce it.</p>
<p>On a subsequent occasion I was present at an interview between
Mr. Nosnibor and the family straightener, who was considered 
competent to watch the completion of the cure.&nbsp; I was struck
with the delicacy with which he avoided even the remotest 
semblance of inquiry after the physical well-being of his 
patient, though there was a certain yellowness about my 
host&rsquo;s eyes which argued a bilious habit of body.&nbsp; To 
have taken notice of this would have been a gross breach of 
professional etiquette.&nbsp; I am told that a straightener 
sometimes thinks it right to glance at the possibility of some 
slight physical disorder if he finds it important in order to 
assist him in his diagnosis; but the answers which he gets are 
generally untrue or evasive, and he forms his own conclusions 
upon the matter as well as he can.</p>
<p>Sensible men have been known to say that the straightener 
should in strict confidence be told of every physical ailment 
that is likely to bear upon the case; but people are naturally 
shy of doing this, for they do not like lowering themselves in 
the opinion of the straightener, and his ignorance of medical 
science is supreme.&nbsp; I heard of one lady however who had the
hardihood to confess that a furious outbreak of ill-humour and 
extravagant fancies for which she was seeking advice was possibly
the result of indisposition.&nbsp; <!-- page 8--><a 
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>&ldquo;You 
should resist that,&rdquo; said the straightener, in a kind, but 
grave voice; &ldquo;we can do nothing for the bodies of our 
patients; such matters are beyond our province, and I desire that
I may hear no further particulars.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lady burst 
into tears, promised faithfully that she would never be unwell 
again, and kept her word.</p>
<p>To return however to Mr. Nosnibor.&nbsp; As the afternoon wore
on many carriages drove up with callers to inquire how he had 
stood his flogging.&nbsp; It had been very severe, but the kind 
inquiries upon every side gave him great pleasure, and he assured
me that he felt almost tempted to do wrong again by the 
solicitude with which his friends had treated him during his 
recovery: in this I need hardly say that he was not serious.</p>
<p>During the remainder of my stay in the country Mr. Nosnibor 
was constantly attentive to his business, and largely increased 
his already great possessions; but I never heard a whisper to the
effect of his having been indisposed a second time, or made money
by other than the most strictly honourable means.&nbsp; I did 
hear afterwards in confidence that there had been reason to 
believe that his health had been not a little affected by the 
straightener&rsquo;s treatment, but his friends did not choose to
be over curious upon the subject, and on his return to his 
affairs it was by common consent passed over as hardly criminal 
in one who was otherwise so much afflicted.&nbsp; For they regard
bodily ailments as the more venial in proportion as they have 
been produced by causes independent of the constitution.&nbsp; 
Thus if a person ruin his health by excessive indulgence at the 
table, or by drinking, they count it to be almost a part of the 
mental disease which brought it <!-- page 9--><a 
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>about and so it
goes for little, but they have no mercy on such illnesses as 
fevers or catarrhs or lung diseases, which to us appear to be 
beyond the control of the individual.&nbsp; They are only more 
lenient towards the diseases of the young&mdash;such as measles, 
which they think to be like sowing one&rsquo;s wild 
oats&mdash;and look over them as pardonable indiscretions if they
have not been too serious, and if they are atoned for by complete
subsequent recovery.</p>
<h3><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>AN EREWHONIAN TRIAL.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">chapter 
xi. of erewhon</span>.)</h3>
<p>I shall best convey to the reader an idea of the entire 
perversion of thought which exists among this extraordinary 
people, by describing the public trial of a man who was accused 
of pulmonary consumption&mdash;an offence which was punished with
death until quite recently.&nbsp; The trial did not take place 
till I had been some months in the country, and I am deviating 
from chronological order in giving an account of it here; but I 
had perhaps better do so in order to exhaust this subject before 
proceeding with others.</p>
<p>The prisoner was placed in the dock, and the jury were sworn 
much as in Europe; almost all our own modes of procedure were 
reproduced, even to the requiring the prisoner to plead guilty or
not guilty.&nbsp; He pleaded not guilty and the case 
proceeded.&nbsp; The evidence for the prosecution was very 
strong, but I must do the court the justice to observe that the 
trial was absolutely impartial.&nbsp; Counsel for the prisoner 
was allowed to urge everything that could be said in his 
defence.</p>
<p>The line taken was that the prisoner was simulating 
consumption in order to defraud an insurance company, from which 
he was about to buy an annuity, and that he hoped thus to obtain 
it on more advantageous terms.&nbsp; <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>If this could
have been shown to be the case he would have escaped criminal 
prosecution, and been sent to a hospital as for moral 
ailment.&nbsp; The view however was one which could not be 
reasonably sustained, in spite of all the ingenuity and eloquence
of one of the most celebrated advocates of the country.&nbsp; The
case was only too clear, for the prisoner was almost at the point
of death, and it was astonishing that he had not been tried and 
convicted long previously.&nbsp; His coughing was incessant 
during the whole trial, and it was all that the two jailers in 
charge of him could do to keep him on his legs until it was 
over.</p>
<p>The summing up of the judge was admirable.&nbsp; He dwelt upon
every point that could be construed in favour of the prisoner, 
but as he proceeded it became clear that the evidence was too 
convincing to admit of doubt, and there was but one opinion in 
the court as to the impending verdict when the jury retired from 
the box.&nbsp; They were absent for about ten minutes, and on 
their return the foreman pronounced the prisoner guilty.&nbsp; 
There was a faint murmur of applause but it was instantly 
repressed.&nbsp; The judge then proceeded to pronounce sentence 
in words which I can never forget, and which I copied out into a 
note-book next day from the report that was published in the 
leading newspaper.&nbsp; I must condense it somewhat, and nothing
which I could say would give more than a faint idea of the 
solemn, not to say majestic, severity with which it was 
delivered.&nbsp; The sentence was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoner at the bar, you have been accused of the great
crime of labouring under pulmonary consumption, and after an 
impartial trial before a jury of your countrymen, you have been 
found guilty.&nbsp; Against the justice of the verdict I can say 
nothing: the <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>evidence against you was conclusive, 
and it only remains for me to pass such a sentence upon you, as 
shall satisfy the ends of the law.&nbsp; That sentence must be a 
very severe one.&nbsp; It pains me much to see one who is yet so 
young, and whose prospects in life were otherwise so excellent, 
brought to this distressing condition by a constitution which I 
can only regard as radically vicious; but yours is no case for 
compassion: this is not your first offence: you have led a career
of crime, and have only profited by the leniency shown you upon 
past occasions, to offend yet more seriously against the laws and
institutions of your country.&nbsp; You were convicted of 
aggravated bronchitis last year: and I find that though you are 
now only twenty-three years old, you have been imprisoned on no 
less than fourteen occasions for illnesses of a more or less 
hateful character; in fact, it is not too much to say that you 
have spent the greater part of your life in a jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all very well for you to say that you came of 
unhealthy parents, and had a severe accident in your childhood 
which permanently undermined your constitution; excuses such as 
these are the ordinary refuge of the criminal; but they cannot 
for one moment be listened to by the ear of justice.&nbsp; I am 
not here to enter upon curious metaphysical questions as to the 
origin of this or that&mdash;questions to which there would be no
end were their introduction once tolerated, and which would 
result in throwing the only guilt on the primordial cell, or 
perhaps even on the elementary gases.&nbsp; There is no question 
of how you came to be wicked, but only this&mdash;namely, are you
wicked or not?&nbsp; This has been decided in the affirmative, 
neither can I hesitate for a single moment to say that it has 
been decided justly.&nbsp; You are a bad and dangerous person, 
and stand <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>branded in the eyes of your 
fellow-countrymen with one of the most heinous known 
offences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my business to justify the law: the law may 
in some cases have its inevitable hardships, and I may feel 
regret at times that I have not the option of passing a less 
severe sentence than I am compelled to do.&nbsp; But yours is no 
such case; on the contrary, had not the capital punishment for 
consumption been abolished, I should certainly inflict it 
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is intolerable that an example of such terrible 
enormity should be allowed to go at large unpunished.&nbsp; Your 
presence in the society of respectable people would lead the less
able-bodied to think more lightly of all forms of illness; 
neither can it be permitted that you should have the chance of 
corrupting unborn beings who might hereafter pester you.&nbsp; 
The unborn must not be allowed to come near you: and this not so 
much for their protection (for they are our natural enemies), as 
for our own; for since they will not be utterly gainsaid, it must
be seen to that they shall be quartered upon those who are least 
likely to corrupt them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But independently of this consideration, and 
independently of the physical guilt which attaches itself to a 
crime so great as yours, there is yet another reason why we 
should be unable to show you mercy, even if we are inclined to do
so.&nbsp; I refer to the existence of a class of men who lie 
hidden among us, and who are called physicians.&nbsp; Were the 
severity of the law or the current feeling of the country to be 
relaxed never so slightly, these abandoned persons, who are now 
compelled to practise secretly, and who can be consulted only at 
the greatest risk, would become frequent visitors in every 
household; their organisation and <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>their 
intimate acquaintance with all family secrets would give them a 
power, both social and political, which nothing could 
resist.&nbsp; The head of the household would become subordinate 
to the family doctor, who would interfere between man and wife, 
between master and servant, until the doctors should be the only 
depositaries of power in the nation, and have all that we hold 
precious at their mercy.&nbsp; A time of universal 
dephysicalisation would ensue; medicine-vendors of all kinds 
would abound in our streets and advertise in all our 
newspapers.&nbsp; There is one remedy for this, and one 
only.&nbsp; It is that which the laws of this country have long 
received and acted upon, and consists in the sternest repression 
of all diseases whatsoever, as soon as their existence is made 
manifest to the eye of the law.&nbsp; Would that that eye were 
far more piercing than it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will enlarge no further upon things that are 
themselves so obvious.&nbsp; You may say that it is not your 
fault.&nbsp; The answer is ready enough at hand, and it amounts 
to this&mdash;that if you had been born of healthy and well-to-do
parents, and been well taken care of when you were a child, you 
would never have offended against the laws of your country, nor 
found yourself in your present disgraceful position.&nbsp; If you
tell me that you had no hand in your parentage and education, and
that it is therefore unjust to lay these things to your charge, I
answer that whether your being in a consumption is your fault or 
no, it is a fault in you, and it is my duty to see that against 
such faults as this the commonwealth shall be protected.&nbsp; 
You may say that it is your misfortune to be criminal; I answer 
that it is your crime to be unfortunate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not hesitate therefore to sentence you to 
imprisonment, <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>with hard labour, for the rest of 
your miserable existence.&nbsp; During that period I would 
earnestly entreat you to repent of these wrongs you have done 
already, and to entirely reform the constitution of your whole 
body.&nbsp; I entertain but little hope that you will pay 
attention to my advice; you are already far too abandoned.&nbsp; 
Did it rest with myself, I should add nothing in mitigation of 
the sentence which I have passed, but it is the merciful 
provision of the law that even the most hardened criminal shall 
be allowed some one of the three official remedies, which is to 
be prescribed at the time of his conviction.&nbsp; I shall 
therefore order that you receive two tablespoonfuls of castor-oil
daily, until the pleasure of the court be further 
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the sentence was concluded, the prisoner acknowledged in 
a few scarcely audible words that he was justly punished, and 
that he had had a fair trial.&nbsp; He was then removed to the 
prison from which he was never to return.&nbsp; There was a 
second attempt at applause when the judge had finished speaking, 
but as before it was at once repressed; and though the feeling of
the court was strongly against the prisoner, there was no show of
any violence against him, if one may except a little hooting from
the bystanders when he was being removed in the prisoners&rsquo; 
van.&nbsp; Indeed, nothing struck me more during my whole sojourn
in the country, than the general respect for law and order.</p>
<h3><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>MALCONTENTS.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">part of chapter 
xii. of erewhon</span>.)</h3>
<p>I write with great diffidence, but it seems to me that there 
is no unfairness in punishing people for their misfortunes, or 
rewarding them for their sheer good luck: it is the normal 
condition of human life that this should be done, and no 
right-minded person will complain at being subjected to the 
common treatment.&nbsp; There is no alternative open to us.&nbsp;
It is idle to say that men are not responsible for their 
misfortunes.&nbsp; What is responsibility?&nbsp; Surely to be 
responsible means to be liable to have to give an answer should 
it be demanded, and all things which live are responsible for 
their lives and actions should society see fit to question them 
through the mouth of its authorised agent.</p>
<p>What is the offence of a lamb that we should rear it, and tend
it, and lull it into security, for the express purpose of killing
it?&nbsp; Its offence is the misfortune of being something which 
society wants to eat, and which cannot defend itself.&nbsp; This 
is ample.&nbsp; Who shall limit the right of society except 
society itself?&nbsp; And what consideration for the individual 
is tolerable unless society be the gainer thereby?&nbsp; 
Wherefore should a man be so richly rewarded for having been son 
to a millionaire, were it not clearly provable that <!-- page 
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the 
common welfare is thus better furthered?&nbsp; We cannot 
seriously detract from a man&rsquo;s merit in having been the son
of a rich father without imperilling our own tenure of things 
which we do not wish to jeopardise; if this were otherwise we 
should not let him keep his money for a single hour; we would 
have it ourselves at once.&nbsp; For property <i>is</i> robbery, 
but then we are all robbers or would-be robbers together, and 
have found it expedient to organise our thieving, as we have 
found it to organise our lust and our revenge.&nbsp; Property, 
marriage, the law; as the bed to the river, so rule and 
convention to the instinct.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; Even in England a man on board a ship 
with yellow fever is held responsible for his mischance, no 
matter what his being kept in quarantine may cost him.&nbsp; He 
may catch the fever and die; we cannot help it; he must take his 
chance as other people do; but surely it would be desperate 
unkindness to add contumely to our self-protection, unless, 
indeed, we believe that contumely is one of our best means of 
self-protection.&nbsp; Again, take the case of maniacs.&nbsp; We 
say that they are irresponsible for their actions, but we take 
good care, or ought to take good care, that they shall answer to 
us for their insanity, and we imprison them in what we call an 
asylum (that modern sanctuary!) if we do not like their 
answers.&nbsp; This is a strange kind of irresponsibility.&nbsp; 
What we ought to say is that we can afford to be satisfied with a
less satisfactory answer from a lunatic than from one who is not 
mad, because lunacy is less infectious than crime.</p>
<p>We kill a serpent if we go in danger by it, simply for being 
such and such a serpent in such and such a place; but we never 
say that the serpent has only <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>itself to 
blame for not having been a harmless creature.&nbsp; Its crime is
that of being the thing which it is: but this is a capital 
offence, and we are right in killing it out of the way, unless we
think it more dangerous to do so than to let it escape; 
nevertheless we pity the creature, even though we kill it.</p>
<p>But in the case of him whose trial I have described above, it 
was impossible that any one in the court should not have known 
that it was but by an accident of birth and circumstances that he
was not himself also in a consumption; and yet none thought that 
it disgraced them to hear the judge give vent to the most cruel 
truisms about him.&nbsp; The judge himself was a kind and 
thoughtful person.&nbsp; He was a man of magnificent and benign 
presence.&nbsp; He was evidently of an iron constitution, and his
face wore an expression of the maturest wisdom and experience; 
yet for all this, old and learned as he was, he could not see 
things which one would have thought would have been apparent even
to a child.&nbsp; He could not emancipate himself from, nay, it 
did not even occur to him to feel, the bondage of the ideas in 
which he had been born and bred.&nbsp; So was it with the jury 
and bystanders; and&mdash;most wonderful of all&mdash;so was it 
even with the prisoner.&nbsp; Throughout he seemed fully 
impressed with the notion that he was being dealt with justly: he
saw nothing wanton in his being told by the judge that he was to 
be punished, not so much as a necessary protection to society 
(although this was not entirely lost sight of), as because he had
not been better born and bred than he was.&nbsp; But this led me 
to hope that he suffered less than he would have done if he had 
seen the matter in the same light that I did.&nbsp; And, after 
all, justice is relative.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>I may here mention that only a few years before my 
arrival in the country, the treatment of all convicted invalids 
had been much more barbarous than now; for no physical remedy was
provided, and prisoners were put to the severest labour in all 
sorts of weather, so that most of them soon succumbed to the 
extreme hardships which they suffered; this was supposed to be 
beneficial in some ways, inasmuch as it put the country to less 
expense for the maintenance of its criminal class; but the growth
of luxury had induced a relaxation of the old severity, and a 
sensitive age would no longer tolerate what appeared to be an 
excess of rigour, even towards the most guilty; moreover, it was 
found that juries were less willing to convict, and justice was 
often cheated because there was no alternative between virtually 
condemning a man to death and letting him go free; it was also 
held that the country paid in recommittals for its overseverity; 
for those who had been imprisoned even for trifling ailments were
often permanently disabled by their imprisonment; and when a man 
has been once convicted, it was probable he would never 
afterwards be long off the hands of the country.</p>
<p>These evils had long been apparent and recognised; yet people 
were too indolent, and too indifferent to suffering not their 
own, to bestir themselves about putting an end to them, until at 
last a benevolent reformer devoted his whole life to effecting 
the necessary changes.&nbsp; He divided illnesses into three 
classes&mdash;those affecting the head, the trunk, and the lower 
limbs&mdash;and obtained an enactment that all diseases of the 
head, whether internal or external, should be treated with 
laudanum, those of the body with castor-oil, and those of the 
lower limbs with an embrocation of strong sulphuric acid and 
water.&nbsp; It may be said <!-- page 20--><a 
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>that the 
classification was not sufficiently careful, and that the 
remedies were ill chosen; but it is a hard thing to initiate any 
reform, and it was necessary to familiarise the public mind with 
the principle, by inserting the thin end of the wedge first: it 
is not therefore to be wondered at that among so practical a 
people there should still be some room for improvement.&nbsp; The
mass of the nation are well pleased with existing arrangements, 
and believe that their treatment of criminals leaves little or 
nothing to be desired; but there is an energetic minority who 
hold what are considered to be extreme opinions, and who are not 
at all disposed to rest contented until the principle lately 
admitted has been carried further.</p>
<h3><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>THE MUSICAL BANKS.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">chapter 
xiv. of erewhon</span>.)</h3>
<p>On my return to the drawing-room, I found the ladies were just
putting away their work and preparing to go out.&nbsp; I asked 
them where they were going.&nbsp; They answered with a certain 
air of reserve that they were going to the bank to get some 
money.</p>
<p>Now I had already collected that the mercantile affairs of the
Erewhonians were conducted on a totally different system from our
own; I had however gathered little hitherto, except that they had
two distinct commercial systems, of which the one appealed more 
strongly to the imagination than anything to which we are 
accustomed in Europe, inasmuch as the banks conducted upon this 
system were decorated in the most profuse fashion, and all 
mercantile transactions were accompanied with music, so that they
were called musical banks though the music was hideous to a 
European ear.</p>
<p>As for the system itself I never understood it, neither can I 
do so now: they have a code in connection with it, which I have 
no doubt they themselves understand, but no foreigner can hope to
do so.&nbsp; One rule runs into and against another as in a most 
complicated grammar, or as in Chinese pronunciation, wherein I am
told the slightest change in accentuation or tone of voice alters
the meaning of a whole sentence.&nbsp; <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Whatever is 
incoherent in my description must be referred to the fact of my 
never having attained to a full comprehension of the subject.</p>
<p>So far however as I could collect anything certain, they 
appeared to have two entirely distinct currencies, each under the
control of its own banks and mercantile codes.&nbsp; The one of 
them (the one with the musical banks) was supposed to be 
<i>the</i> system, and to give out the currency in which all 
monetary transactions should be carried on.&nbsp; As far as I 
could see, all who wished to be considered respectable, did keep 
a certain amount of this currency at these banks; nevertheless, 
if there is one thing of which I am more sure than another it is 
that the amount so kept was but a very small part of their 
possessions.&nbsp; I think they took the money, put it into the 
bank, and then drew it out again, repeating the process day by 
day, and keeping a certain amount of currency for this purpose 
and no other, while they paid the expenses of the bank with the 
other coinage.&nbsp; I am sure the managers and cashiers of the 
musical banks were not paid in their own currency.&nbsp; Mr. 
Nosnibor used to go to these musical banks, or rather to the 
great mother bank of the city, sometimes but not very 
often.&nbsp; He was a pillar of one of the other kind of banks, 
though he held some minor office also in these.&nbsp; The ladies 
generally went alone; as indeed was the case in most families, 
except on some few great annual occasions.</p>
<p>I had long wanted to know more of this strange system, and had
the greatest desire to accompany my hostess and her 
daughters.&nbsp; I had seen them go out almost every morning 
since my arrival, and had noticed that they carried their purses 
in their hands, not exactly ostentatiously, yet just so as that 
those <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>who met them should see whither they 
were going.&nbsp; I had never yet been asked to go with them 
myself.</p>
<p>It is not easy to convey a person&rsquo;s manner by words, and
I can hardly give any idea of the peculiar feeling which came 
upon me whenever I saw the ladies in the hall, with their purses 
in their hands, and on the point of starting for the bank.&nbsp; 
There was a something of regret, a something as though they would
wish to take me with them, but did not like to ask me, and yet as
though I were hardly to ask to be taken.&nbsp; I was determined 
however to bring matters to an issue with my hostess about my 
going with them, and after a little parleying and many inquiries 
as to whether I was perfectly sure that I myself wished to go, it
was decided that I might do so.</p>
<p>We passed through several streets of more or less considerable
houses, and at last turning round a corner we came upon a large 
piazza, at the end of which was a magnificent building, of a 
strange but noble architecture and of great antiquity.&nbsp; It 
did not open directly on to the piazza, there being a screen, 
through which was an archway, between the piazza and the actual 
precincts of the bank.&nbsp; On passing under the archway we 
found ourselves upon a green sward, round which there ran an 
arcade or cloister, while in front of us uprose the majestic 
towers of the bank and its venerable front, which was divided 
into three deep recesses and adorned with all sorts of marbles 
and many sculptures.&nbsp; On either side there were beautiful 
old trees wherein the birds were busy by the hundred, and a 
number of quaint but substantial houses of singularly comfortable
appearance; they were situated in the midst of orchards and 
gardens, and gave me an impression of great peace and plenty.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>Indeed it had been no error to say that this building 
was one which appealed to the imagination; it did more&mdash;it 
carried both imagination and judgment by storm.&nbsp; It was an 
epic in stone and marble; neither had I ever seen anything in the
least comparable to it.&nbsp; I was completely charmed and 
melted.&nbsp; I felt more conscious of the existence of a remote 
past.&nbsp; One knows of this always, but the knowledge is never 
so living as in the actual presence of some witness to the life 
of bygone ages.&nbsp; I felt how short a space of human life was 
the period of our own existence.&nbsp; I was more impressed with 
my own littleness, and much more inclinable to believe that the 
people whose sense of the fitness of things was equal to the 
upraising of so serene a handiwork, were hardly likely to be 
wrong in the conclusions they might come to upon any 
subject.&nbsp; My feeling certainly was that the currency of this
bank must be the right one.</p>
<p>We crossed the sward and entered the building.&nbsp; If the 
outside had been impressive the inside was even more so.&nbsp; It
was very lofty and divided into several parts by walls which 
rested upon massive pillars; the windows were filled with glass, 
on which had been painted the principal commercial incidents of 
the bank for many ages.&nbsp; In a remote part of the building 
there were men and boys singing; this was the only disturbing 
feature, for as the gamut was still unknown, there was no music 
in the country which could be agreeable to a European ear.&nbsp; 
The singers seemed to have derived their inspirations from the 
songs of birds and the wailing of the wind, which last they tried
to imitate in melancholy cadences which at times degenerated into
a howl.&nbsp; To my thinking the noise was hideous, but it 
produced a great effect upon <!-- page 25--><a 
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>my 
companions, who professed themselves much moved.&nbsp; As soon as
the singing was over the ladies requested me to stay where I was,
while they went inside the place from which it had seemed to 
come.</p>
<p>During their absence certain reflections forced themselves 
upon me.</p>
<p>In the first place, it struck me as strange that the building 
should be so nearly empty; I was almost alone, and the few 
besides myself had been led by curiosity, and had no intention of
doing business with the bank.&nbsp; But there might be more 
inside.&nbsp; I stole up to the curtain, and ventured to draw the
extreme edge of it on one side.&nbsp; No, there was hardly any 
one there.&nbsp; I saw a large number of cashiers, all at their 
desks ready to pay cheques, and one or two who seemed to be the 
managing partners.&nbsp; I also saw my hostess and her daughters 
and two or three other ladies; also three or four old women and 
the boys from one of the neighbouring Colleges of Unreason; but 
there was no one else.&nbsp; This did not look as though the bank
was doing a very large business; and yet I had always been told 
that every one in the city dealt with this establishment.</p>
<p>I cannot describe all that took place in these inner 
precincts, for a sinister-looking person in a black gown came and
made unpleasant gestures at me for peeping.&nbsp; I happened to 
have in my pocket one of the musical bank pieces, which had been 
given me by Mrs. Nosnibor, so I tried to tip him with it; but 
having seen what it was, he became so angry that it was all I 
could do to pacify him.&nbsp; When he was gone I ventured to take
a second look, and saw Zulora in the very act of giving a piece 
of paper which looked like a cheque to one of the cashiers.&nbsp;
He did not <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>examine it, but putting his hand into
an antique coffer hard by, he pulled out a quantity of 
dull-looking metal pieces apparently at random, and handed them 
over without counting them; neither did Zulora count them, but 
put them into her purse and departed.&nbsp; It seemed a very 
singular proceeding, but I supposed that they knew their own 
business best, at any rate Zulora seemed quite satisfied, thanked
him for the money, and began making towards the curtain: on this 
I let it drop and retreated to a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nosnibor and her daughters soon joined me.&nbsp; For some
few minutes we all kept silence, but at last I ventured to remark
that the bank was not so busy to-day as it probably often 
was.&nbsp; On this Mrs. Nosnibor said that it was indeed 
melancholy to see what little heed people paid to the most 
precious of all institutions.&nbsp; I could say nothing in reply,
but I have ever been of opinion that the greater part of mankind 
do approximately know where they get that which does them 
good.&nbsp; Mrs. Nosnibor went on to say that I must not imagine 
there was any want of confidence in the bank because I had seen 
so few people there; the heart of the country was thoroughly 
devoted to these establishments, and any sign of their being in 
danger would bring in support from the most unexpected 
quarters.&nbsp; It was only because people knew them to be so 
very safe, that in some cases (as she lamented to say in Mr. 
Nosnibor&rsquo;s) they felt that their support was 
unnecessary.&nbsp; Moreover these institutions never departed 
from the safest and most approved banking principles.&nbsp; Thus 
they never allowed interest on deposit, a thing now frequently 
done by certain bubble companies, which by doing an illegitimate 
trade had drawn many customers away; and even the shareholders 
were fewer than <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>formerly, owing to the innovations of
these unscrupulous persons.</p>
<p>It came out by and by that the musical banks paid little or no
dividend, but divided their profits by way of bonus on the 
original shares once in every three hundred and fifty years; and 
as it was now only two hundred years since there had been one of 
these distributions, people felt that they could not hope for 
another in their own time and preferred investments whereby they 
got some more tangible return; all which, she said, was very 
melancholy to think of.</p>
<p>Having made these last admissions, she returned to her 
original statement, namely, that every one in the country really 
supported the bank.&nbsp; As to the fewness of the people, and 
the absence of the able-bodied, she pointed out to me with some 
justice that this was exactly what we ought to expect.&nbsp; The 
men who were most conversant about the stability of human 
institutions, such as the lawyers, men of science, doctors, 
statesmen, painters, and the like, were just those who were most 
likely to be misled by their own fancied accomplishments, and to 
be made unduly suspicious by their licentious desire for greater 
present return, which was at the root of nine-tenths of the 
opposition, by their vanity, which would prompt them to affect 
superiority to the prejudices of the vulgar, and by the stings of
their own conscience, which was constantly upbraiding them in the
most cruel manner on account of their bodies, which were 
generally diseased; let a person&rsquo;s intellect be never so 
sound, unless his body were in absolute health, he could form no 
judgment worth having on matters of this kind.&nbsp; The body was
everything: it need not perhaps be such a <i>strong</i> body (she
said this because she saw I was thinking of the <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>old and 
infirm-looking folks whom I had seen in the bank), but it must be
in perfect health; in this case, the less active strength it had 
the more free would be the working of the intellect, and 
therefore the sounder the conclusion.&nbsp; The people, then, 
whom I had seen at the bank were in reality the very ones whose 
opinions were most worth having; they declared its advantages to 
be incalculable, and even professed to consider the immediate 
return to be far larger than they were entitled to; and so she 
ran on, nor did she leave off till we had got back to the 
house.</p>
<p>She might say what she pleased, but her manner was not one 
that carried much conviction; and later on I saw signs of general
indifference to these banks that were not to be mistaken.&nbsp; 
Their supporters often denied it, but the denial was generally so
couched as to add another proof of its existence.&nbsp; In 
commercial panics, and in times of general distress, the people 
as a mass did not so much as even think of turning to these 
banks.&nbsp; A few individuals might do so, some from habit and 
early training, some from hope of gain, but few from a genuine 
belief that the money was good; the masses turned instinctively 
to the other currency.&nbsp; In a conversation with one of the 
musical bank managers I ventured to hint this as plainly as 
politeness would allow.&nbsp; He said that it had been more or 
less true till lately; but that now they had put fresh stained 
glass windows into all the banks in the country, and repaired the
buildings, and enlarged the organs, and taken to talking nicely 
to the people in the streets, and to remembering the ages of 
their children and giving them things when they were ill, so that
all would henceforth go smoothly.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
29</span>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you done anything to the money 
itself?&rdquo; said I timidly.</p>
<p>To this day I do not know exactly what the bank-manager said, 
but it came to this in the end&mdash;that I had better not meddle
with things that I did not understand.</p>
<p>On reviewing the whole matter, I can be certain of this much 
only, that the money given out at the musical banks is not the 
current coin of the realm.&nbsp; It is not the money with which 
the people do as a general rule buy their bread, meat, and 
clothing.&nbsp; It is like it; some coins very like it; and it is
not counterfeit.&nbsp; It is not, take it all round, a spurious 
article made of base metal in imitation of the money which is in 
daily use; but it is a distinct coinage which, though I do not 
suppose it ever actually superseded the ordinary gold, silver, 
and copper, was probably issued by authority, and was intended to
supplant those metals.&nbsp; Some of the pieces were really of 
exquisite beauty; and some were, I do verily believe, nothing but
the ordinary currency, only that there was another head and name 
in place of that of the commonwealth.&nbsp; And here was one of 
the great marvels; for those who were most strongly in favour of 
this coinage maintained, and even grew more excited if they were 
opposed here than on any other matter, that the very self-same 
coin with the head of the commonwealth upon it was of little if 
any value, while it became exceedingly precious it stamped with 
the other image.</p>
<p>Some of the coins were plainly bad; of these last there were 
not many; still there were enough for them to be not 
uncommon.&nbsp; These were entirely composed of alloy; they would
bend easily, would melt away to <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>nothing with 
a little heat, and were quite unsuited for a currency.&nbsp; Yet 
there were few of the wealthier classes who did not maintain that
even these coins were genuine good money, though they were chary 
of taking them.&nbsp; Every one knew this, so they were seldom 
offered; but all thought it incumbent upon them to retain a good 
many in their possession, and to let them be seen from time to 
time in their hands and purses.&nbsp; Of course people knew their
real value exceedingly well; but few, if any, dared to say what 
that value was; or if they did, it would be only in certain 
companies or in writing in the newspapers anonymously.&nbsp; 
Strange! there was hardly any insinuation against this coinage 
which they would not tolerate and even applaud in their daily 
papers; and yet, if the same thing were said without ambiguity to
their faces&mdash;nominative case verb and accusative being all 
in their right places, and doubt impossible&mdash;they would 
consider themselves very seriously and justly outraged, and 
accuse the speaker of being unwell.</p>
<p>I never could understand, neither can I do so now, why a 
single currency should not suffice them; it would seem to me as 
though all their dealings would have been thus greatly 
simplified; but I was met with a look of horror if ever I dared 
to hint at it.&nbsp; Even those who to my certain knowledge kept 
only just enough money at the musical banks to swear by, would 
call the other banks (where their securities really lay) cold, 
deadening, paralysing, and the like.&nbsp; I noticed another 
thing moreover which struck me greatly.&nbsp; I was taken to the 
opening of one of these banks in a neighbouring town, and saw a 
large assemblage of cashiers and managers.&nbsp; I sat opposite 
them and scanned their faces attentively.&nbsp; They did <!-- 
page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
31</span>not please me; they lacked, with a few exceptions, the 
true Erewhonian frankness; and an equal number from any other 
class would have looked happier and better men.&nbsp; When I met 
them in the streets they did not seem like other people, but had,
as a general rule, a cramped expression upon their faces which 
pained and depressed me.</p>
<p>Those who came from the country were better; they seemed to 
have lived less as a separate class, and to be freer and 
healthier; but in spite of my seeing not a few whose looks were 
benign and noble, I could not help asking myself concerning the 
greater number of those whom I met, whether Erewhon would be a 
better country if their expression were to be transferred to the 
people in general.&nbsp; I answered myself emphatically, 
no.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s expression is his sacrament; it is the 
outward and visible sign of his inward and spiritual grace, or, 
want of grace; and as I looked at the majority of these men, I 
could not help feeling that there must be a something in their 
lives which had stunted their natural development, and that they 
would have been more healthily-minded in any other 
profession.</p>
<p>I was always sorry for them, for in nine cases out of ten they
were well-meaning persons; they were in the main very poorly 
paid; their constitutions were as a rule above suspicion; and 
there were recorded numberless instances of their self-sacrifice 
and generosity; but they had had the misfortune to have been 
betrayed into a false position at an age for the most part when 
their judgment was not matured, and after having been kept in 
studied ignorance of the real difficulties of the system.&nbsp; 
But this did not make their position the less a false one, and 
its bad effects upon themselves were unmistakable.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>Few people would speak quite openly and freely before 
them, which struck me as a very bad sign.&nbsp; When they were in
the room every one would talk as though all currency save that of
the musical banks should be abolished; and yet they knew 
perfectly well that even the cashiers themselves hardly used the 
musical bank money more than other people.&nbsp; It was expected 
of them that they should appear to do so, but this was all.&nbsp;
The less thoughtful of them did not seem particularly unhappy, 
but many were plainly sick at heart, though perhaps they hardly 
knew it, and would not have owned to being so.&nbsp; Some few 
were opponents of the whole system; but these were liable to be 
dismissed from their employment at any moment, and this rendered 
them very careful, for a man who had once been cashier at a 
musical bank was out of the field for other employment, and was 
generally unfitted for it by reason of that course of treatment 
which was commonly called his education.&nbsp; In fact it was a 
career from which retreat was virtually impossible, and into 
which young men were generally induced to enter before they could
be reasonably expected, considering their training, to have 
formed any opinions of their own.&nbsp; Few indeed were those who
had the courage to insist on seeing both sides of the question 
before they committed themselves to either.&nbsp; One would have 
thought that this was an elementary principle,&mdash;one of the 
first things that an honourable man would teach his boy to do; 
but in practice it was not so.</p>
<p>I even saw cases in which parents bought the right of 
presenting to the office of cashier at one of these banks, with 
the fixed determination that some one of their sons (perhaps a 
mere child) should fill it.&nbsp; There was the lad 
himself&mdash;growing up with every promise <!-- page 33--><a 
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>of becoming a
good and honourable man&mdash;but utterly without warning 
concerning the iron shoe which his natural protector was 
providing for him.&nbsp; Who could say that the whole thing would
not end in a life-long lie, and vain chafing to escape?</p>
<p>I confess that there were few things in Erewhon which shocked 
me more than this.</p>
<h3><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>BIRTH FORMUL&AElig;.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">chapter 
xvii. of erewhon</span>.)</h3>
<p>I heard what follows not from Arowhena, but from Mr. Nosnibor 
and some of the gentlemen who occasionally dined at the house: 
they told me that the Erewhonians believe in pre-existence; and 
not only this (of which I will write more fully in the next 
chapter), but they believe that it is of their own free act and 
deed in a previous state that people come to be born into this 
world at all.</p>
<p>They hold that the unborn are perpetually plaguing and 
tormenting the married (and sometimes even the unmarried) of both
sexes, fluttering about them incessantly, and giving them no 
peace either of mind or body until they have consented to take 
them under their protection.&nbsp; If this were not so&mdash;this
is at least what they urge&mdash;it would be a monstrous freedom 
for one man to take with another, to say that he should undergo 
the chances and changes of this mortal life without any option in
the matter.&nbsp; No man would have any right to get married at 
all, inasmuch as he can never tell what misery his doing so may 
entail forcibly upon his children who cannot be unhappy as long 
as they remain unborn.&nbsp; They feel this so strongly that they
are resolved to shift the blame on to other shoulders; they have 
therefore invented a long mythology as to the world in which the 
unborn people live, what they do, <!-- page 35--><a 
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>and the arts 
and machinations to which they have recourse in order to get 
themselves into our own world.</p>
<p>I cannot think they seriously believe in this mythology 
concerning pre-existence; they do and they do not; they do not 
know themselves what they believe; all they know is that it is a 
disease not to believe as they do.&nbsp; The only thing of which 
they are quite sure is that it is the pestering of the unborn, 
which causes them to be brought into this world, and that they 
would not be here if they would only let peaceable people 
alone.</p>
<p>It would be hard to disprove this position, and they might 
have a good case if they would only leave it as it stands.&nbsp; 
But this they will not do; they must have assurance doubly sure; 
they must have the written word of the child itself as soon as it
is born, giving the parents indemnity from all responsibility on 
the score of its birth, and asserting its own 
pre-existence.&nbsp; They have therefore devised something which 
they call a birth formula&mdash;a document which varies in words 
according to the caution of parents, but is much the same 
practically in all cases; for it has been the business of the 
Erewhonian lawyers during many ages to exercise their skill in 
perfecting it and providing for every contingency.</p>
<p>These formul&aelig; are printed on common paper at a moderate 
cost for the poor; but the rich have them written on parchment 
and handsomely bound, so that the getting up of a person&rsquo;s 
birth formula is a test of his social position.&nbsp; They 
commence by setting forth, That whereas A. B. was a member of the
kingdom of the unborn, where he was well provided for in every 
way, and had no cause of discontent, &amp;c. &amp;c., he did of 
his own wanton restlessness conceive a desire <!-- page 36--><a 
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>to enter into
this present world; that thereon having taken the necessary steps
as set forth in laws of the unborn kingdom, he set himself with 
malice aforethought to plague and pester two unfortunate people 
who had never wronged him, and who were quite contented until he 
conceived this base design against their peace; for which wrong 
he now humbly entreats their pardon.&nbsp; He acknowledges that 
he is responsible for all physical blemishes and deficiencies 
which may render him answerable to the laws of his country; that 
his parents have nothing whatever to do with any of these things;
and that they have a right to kill him at once if they be so 
minded, though he entreats them to show their marvellous goodness
and clemency towards him by sparing his life.&nbsp; If they will 
do this he promises to be their most abject creature during his 
earlier years, and indeed unto his life&rsquo;s end, unless they 
should see fit in their abundant generosity to remit some portion
of his service hereafter.&nbsp; And so the formula continues, 
going sometimes into very minute details, according to the 
fancies of family lawyers, who will not make it any shorter than 
they can help.</p>
<p>The deed being thus prepared, on the third or fourth day after
the birth of the child, or as they call it, the &ldquo;final 
importunity,&rdquo; the friends gather together, and there is a 
feast held, where they are all very melancholy&mdash;as a general
rule, I believe quite truly so&mdash;and make presents to the 
father and mother of the child in order to console them for the 
injury which has just been done them by the unborn.&nbsp; By and 
by the child himself is brought down by his nurse, and the 
company begin to rail upon him, upbraiding him for his 
impertinence and asking him <!-- page 37--><a 
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>what amends 
he proposes to make for the wrong that he has committed, and how 
he can look for care and nourishment from those who have perhaps 
already been injured by the unborn on some ten or twelve 
occasions; for they say of people with large families, that they 
have suffered terrible injuries from the unborn; till at last, 
when this has been carried far enough, some one suggests the 
formula, which is brought forth and solemnly read to the child by
the family straightener.&nbsp; This gentleman is always invited 
on these occasions, for the very fact of intrusion into a 
peaceful family shows a depravity on the part of the child which 
requires his professional services.</p>
<p>On being teased by the reading and tweaked by the nurse, the 
child will commonly fall a-crying, which is reckoned a good sign 
as showing a consciousness of guilt.&nbsp; He is thereon asked, 
Does he assent to the formula? on which, as he still continues 
crying and can obviously make no answer, some one of the friends 
comes forward and undertakes to sign the document on his behalf, 
feeling sure (so he says) that the child would do it if he only 
knew how, and that he will release the present signer from his 
engagement on arriving at maturity.&nbsp; The friend then 
inscribes the signature of the child at the foot of the 
parchment, which is held to bind the child as much as though he 
had signed it himself.&nbsp; Even this, however, does not fully 
content them, for they feel a little uneasy until they have got 
the child&rsquo;s own signature after all.&nbsp; So when he is 
about fourteen these good people partly bribe him by promises of 
greater liberty and good things, and partly intimidate him 
through their great power of making themselves passively 
unpleasant to him, so that though there is a show of freedom 
made, <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>there is really none, and partly they
use the offices of the teachers in the Colleges of Unreason, till
at last, in one way or another, they take very good care that he 
shall sign the paper by which he professes to have been a free 
agent in coming into the world, and to take all the 
responsibility of having done so on to his own shoulders.&nbsp; 
And yet, though this document is in theory the most important 
which any one can sign in his whole life, they will have him 
commit himself to it at an age when neither they nor the law will
for many a year allow any one else to bind him to the smallest 
obligation, no matter how righteously he may owe it, because they
hold him too young to know what he is about.</p>
<p>I thought this seemed rather hard, and not of a piece with the
many admirable institutions existing among them.&nbsp; I once 
ventured to say a part of what I thought about it to one of the 
Professors of Unreason.&nbsp; I asked him whether he did not 
think it would do serious harm to a lad&rsquo;s principles, and 
weaken his sense of the sanctity of his word, and of truth 
generally, that he should be led into entering upon an engagement
which it was so plainly impossible he should keep even for a 
single day with tolerable integrity&mdash;whether, in fact, the 
teachers who so led him, or who taught anything as a certainty of
which they were themselves uncertain, were not earning their 
living by impairing the truth-sense of their pupils.&nbsp; The 
professor, who was a delightful person, seemed surprised at the 
view I took, and gave me to understand, perhaps justly enough, 
that I ought not to make so much fuss about a trifle.&nbsp; No 
one, he said, expected that the boy either would or could do all 
that he undertook; but the world was full of compromises; and 
there was hardly any engagement <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>which would 
bear being interpreted literally.&nbsp; Human language was too 
gross a vehicle of thought&mdash;thought being incapable of 
absolute translation.&nbsp; He added, that as there can be no 
translation from one language into another which shall not scant 
the meaning somewhat, or enlarge upon it, so there is no language
which can render thought without a jarring and a harshness 
somewhere&mdash;and so forth; all of which seemed to come to this
in the end, that it was the custom of the country, and that the 
Erewhonians were a conservative people; that the boy would have 
to begin compromising sooner or later, and this was part of his 
education in the art.&nbsp; It was perhaps to be regretted that 
compromise should be as necessary as it was; still it was 
necessary, and the sooner the boy got to understand it the better
for himself.&nbsp; But they never tell this to the boy.</p>
<p>From the book of their mythology about the unborn I made the 
extracts which will form the following chapter.</p>
<h3><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span>THE WORLD OF THE UNBORN.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">part
of chapter xvii. of erewhon</span>.)</h3>
<p>The Erewhonians say it was by chance only that the earth and 
stars and all the heavenly worlds began to roll from east to 
west, and not from west to east, and in like manner they say it 
is by chance that man is drawn through life with his face to the 
past instead of to the future.&nbsp; For the future is there as 
much as the past, only that we may not see it.&nbsp; Is it not in
the loins of the past, and must not the past alter before the 
future can do so?</p>
<p>They have a fable that there was a race of men tried upon the 
earth once, who knew the future better than the past, but that 
they died in a twelvemonth from the misery which their knowledge 
caused them.&nbsp; They say that if any were to be born too 
prescient now, he would die miserably, before he had time to 
transmit so peace-destroying a faculty to descendants.</p>
<p>Strange fate for man!&nbsp; He must perish if he get that, 
which he must perish if he strive not after.&nbsp; If he strive 
not after it he is no better than the brutes, if he get it he is 
more miserable than the devils.</p>
<p>Having waded through many chapters like the above, I came at 
last to the unborn themselves, and found that they were held to 
be souls pure and simple, having no actual bodies, but living in 
a sort of gaseous <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>yet more or less anthropomorphic 
existence, like that of a ghost; they have thus neither flesh nor
blood nor warmth.&nbsp; Nevertheless they are supposed to have 
local habitations and cities wherein they dwell, though these are
as unsubstantial as their inhabitants; they are even thought to 
eat and drink some thin ambrosial sustenance, and generally to be
capable of doing whatever mankind can do, only after a visionary 
ghostly fashion, as in a dream.&nbsp; On the other hand, as long 
as they remain where they are they never die&mdash;the only form 
of death in the unborn world being the leaving it for our 
own.&nbsp; They are believed to be extremely numerous, far more 
so than mankind.&nbsp; They arrive from unknown planets, full 
grown, in large batches at a time; but they can only leave the 
unborn world by taking the steps necessary for their arrival 
here&mdash;which is, in fact, by suicide.</p>
<p>They ought to be a happy people, for they have no extremes of 
good or ill fortune; never marrying, but living in a state much 
like that fabled by the poets as the primitive condition of 
mankind.&nbsp; In spite of this, however, they are incessantly 
complaining; they know that we in this world have bodies, and 
indeed they know everything else about us, for they move among us
whithersoever they will, and can read our thoughts, as well as 
survey our actions at pleasure.&nbsp; One would think that this 
should be enough for them; and indeed most of them are alive to 
the desperate risk which they will run by indulging themselves in
that body with &ldquo;sensible warm motion&rdquo; which they so 
much desire; nevertheless, there are some to whom the 
<i>ennui</i> of a disembodied existence is so intolerable that 
they will venture anything for a change; so they resolve to 
quit.&nbsp; The conditions which they must accept are <!-- page 
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>so 
uncertain, that none but the most foolish of the unborn will 
consent to take them; and it is from these and these only that 
our own ranks are recruited.</p>
<p>When they have finally made up their minds to leave, they must
go before the magistrate of the nearest town and sign an 
affidavit of their desire to quit their then existence.&nbsp; On 
their having done this, the magistrate reads them the conditions 
which they must accept, and which are so long that I can only 
extract some of the principal points, which are mainly the 
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, they must take a potion which will destroy their memory
and sense of identity; they must go into the world helpless, and 
without a will of their own; they must draw lots for their 
dispositions before they go, and take it, such as it is, for 
better or worse&mdash;neither are they to be allowed any choice 
in the matter of the body which they so much desire; they are 
simply allotted by chance, and without appeal, to two people whom
it is their business to find and pester until they adopt 
them.&nbsp; Who these are to be, whether rich or poor, kind or 
unkind, healthy or diseased, there is no knowing; they have, in 
fact, to entrust themselves for many years to the care of those 
for whose good constitution and good sense they have no sort of 
guarantee.</p>
<p>It is curious to read the lectures which the wiser heads give 
to those who are meditating a change.&nbsp; They talk with them 
as we talk with a spendthrift, and with about as much 
success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be born,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;is a 
felony&mdash;it is a capital crime, for which sentence may be 
executed at any moment after the commission of the offence.&nbsp;
You may perhaps happen to live for some seventy or eighty years, 
but what is that, in comparison with the eternity <!-- page 
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>which
you now enjoy?&nbsp; And even though the sentence were commuted, 
and you were allowed to live for ever, you would in time become 
so terribly weary of life that execution would be the greatest 
mercy to you.&nbsp; Consider the infinite risk; to be born of 
wicked parents and trained in vice! to be born of silly parents, 
and trained to unrealities! of parents who regard you as a sort 
of chattel or property, belonging more to them than to 
yourself!&nbsp; Again, you may draw utterly unsympathetic 
parents, who will never be able to understand you, and who will 
thwart you as long as they can to the utmost of their power (as a
hen when she has hatched a duckling), and then call you 
ungrateful because you do not love them, or parents who may look 
upon you as a thing to be cowed while it is still young, lest it 
should give them trouble hereafter by having wishes and feelings 
of its own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In later life, when you have been finally allowed to 
pass muster as a full member of the world, you will yourself 
become liable to the pesterings of the unborn&mdash;and a very 
happy life you may be led in consequence!&nbsp; For we solicit so
strongly that a few only&mdash;nor these the best&mdash;can 
refuse us; and yet not to refuse is much the same as going into 
partnership with half a dozen different people about whom one can
know absolutely nothing beforehand&mdash;not even whether one is 
going into partnership with men or women, nor with how many of 
either.&nbsp; Delude not yourself with thinking that you will be 
wiser than your parents.&nbsp; You may be an age in advance of 
<i>them</i>, but unless you are one of the great ones (and if you
are one of the great ones, woe betide you), you will still be an 
age behind your children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine what it must be to have an unborn <!-- page 
44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
44</span>quartered upon you, who is of a different temperament to
your own; nay, half a dozen such, who will not love you though 
you may tell them that you have stinted yourself in a thousand 
ways to provide for their well-being,&mdash;who will forget all 
that self-sacrifice of which you are yourself so conscious, and 
of whom you may never be sure that they are not bearing a grudge 
against you for errors of judgment into which you may have 
fallen, but which you had hoped had been long since atoned 
for.&nbsp; Ingratitude such as this is not uncommon, yet fancy 
what it must be to bear!&nbsp; It is hard upon the duckling to 
have been hatched by a hen, but is it not also hard upon the hen 
to have hatched the duckling?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider it again, we pray you, not for our sake but 
for your own.&nbsp; Your initial character you must draw by lot; 
but whatever it is, it can only come to a tolerably successful 
development after long training; remember that over that training
you will have no control.&nbsp; It is possible, and even 
probable, that whatever you may get in after life which is of 
real pleasure and service to you, will have to be won in spite 
of, rather than by the help of, those whom you are now about to 
pester, and that you will only win your freedom after years of a 
painful struggle, in which it will be hard to say whether you 
have suffered most injury, or inflicted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember also, that if you go into the world you will 
have free will; that you will be obliged to have it, that there 
is no escaping it, that you will be fettered to it during your 
whole life, and must on every occasion do that which on the whole
seems best to you at any given time, no matter whether you are 
right or wrong in choosing it.&nbsp; Your mind will be a balance 
for considerations, <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and your action will go with the 
heavier scale.&nbsp; How it shall fall will depend upon the kind 
of scales which you may have drawn at birth, the bias which they 
will have obtained by use, and the weight of the immediate 
considerations.&nbsp; If the scales were good to start with, and 
if they have not been outrageously tampered with in childhood, 
and if the combinations into which you enter are average ones, 
you may come off well; but there are too many &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; 
in this, and with the failure of any one of them your misery is 
assured.&nbsp; Reflect on this, and remember that should the ill 
come upon you, you will have yourself to thank, for it is your 
own choice to be born, and there is no compulsion in the 
matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that we deny the existence of pleasures among 
mankind; there is a certain show of sundry phases of contentment 
which may even amount to very considerable happiness; but mark 
how they are distributed over a man&rsquo;s life, belonging, all 
the keenest of them, to the fore part, and few indeed to the 
after.&nbsp; Can there be any pleasure worth purchasing with the 
miseries of a decrepit age?&nbsp; If you are good, strong, and 
handsome, you have a fine fortune indeed at twenty, but how much 
of it will be left at sixty?&nbsp; For you must live on your 
capital; there is no investing your powers so that you may get a 
small annuity of life for ever: you must eat up your principal 
bit by bit and be tortured by seeing it grow continually smaller 
and smaller, even though you happen to escape being rudely robbed
of it by crime or casualty.&nbsp; Remember, too, that there never
yet was a man of forty who would not come back into the world of 
the unborn if he could do so with decency and honour.&nbsp; Being
in the world, he will as a general rule stay till he is forced to
go; but do you think that <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>he would 
consent to be born again, and re-live his life, if he had the 
offer of doing so?&nbsp; Do not think it.&nbsp; If he could so 
alter the past as that he should never have come into being at 
all, do you not think that he would do it very gladly?&nbsp; What
was it that one of their own poets meant, if it was not this, 
when he cried out upon the day in which he was born, and the 
night in which it was said there is a man child conceived?&nbsp; 
&lsquo;For now,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I should have lain still 
and been quiet, I should have slept; then had I been at rest with
kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places 
for themselves; or with princes that had gold, who filled their 
houses with silver; or as an hidden untimely birth, I had not 
been; as infants which never saw light.&nbsp; There the wicked 
cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Be 
very sure that the guilt of being born carries this punishment at
times to all men; but how can they ask for pity, or complain of 
any mischief that may befall them, having entered open-eyed into 
the snare?</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word more and we have done.&nbsp; If any faint 
remembrance, as of a dream, flit in some puzzled moment across 
your brain, and you shall feel that the potion which is to be 
given you shall not have done its work, and the memory of this 
existence which you are leaving endeavours vainly to return; we 
say in such a moment, when you clutch at the dream but it eludes 
your grasp, and you watch it, as Orpheus watched Eurydice, 
gliding back again into the twilight kingdom, 
fly&mdash;fly&mdash;if you can remember the advice&mdash;to the 
haven of your present and immediate duty, taking shelter 
incessantly in the work which you have in hand.&nbsp; This much 
you may perhaps recall; and this, if you will imprint it deeply 
upon your every <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>faculty, will be most likely to bring
you safely and honourably home through the trials that are before
you.&rdquo; <a name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47" 
class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p>This is the fashion in which they reason with those who would 
be for leaving them, but it is seldom that they do much good, for
none but the unquiet and unreasonable ever think of being born, 
and those who are foolish enough to think of it are generally 
foolish enough to do it.&nbsp; Finding therefore that they can do
no more, the friends follow weeping to the courthouse of the 
chief magistrate, where the one who wishes to be born declares 
solemnly and openly that he accepts the conditions attached to 
his decision.&nbsp; On this he is presented with the potion, 
which immediately destroys his memory and sense of identity, and 
dissipates the thin gaseous tenement which he has inhabited: he 
becomes a bare vital principle, not to be perceived by human 
senses, nor appreciated by any chemical test.&nbsp; He has but 
one instinct, which is that he is to go to such and such a place,
where he will find two persons whom he is to importune till they 
consent to undertake him; but whether he is to find these persons
among the race of Chowbok or the Erewhonians themselves is not 
for him to choose.</p>

48</span>SELECTIONS FROM THE FAIR HAVEN.</h2>
<h3>MEMOIR OF THE LATE JOHN PICKARD OWEN.&nbsp; (<span 
class="smcap">chapter i. of the fair haven</span>.) <a 
name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48" 
class="citation">[48]</a></h3>
<p>The subject of this memoir, and author of the work which 
follows it, was born in Goodge Street, Tottenham Court Road, 
London, on the 5th of February 1832.&nbsp; He was my elder 
brother by about eighteen months.&nbsp; Our father and mother had
once been rich, but through a succession of unavoidable 
misfortunes they were left with but a slender income when my 
brother and myself were about three and four years old.&nbsp; My 
father died some five or six years afterwards, and we only 
recollected him as a singularly gentle and humorous playmate who 
doted upon us both and never spoke unkindly.</p>
<p>The charm of such a recollection can never be dispelled; both 
my brother and myself returned his love with interest, and 
cherished his memory with the most affectionate regret, from the 
day on which he left us till the time came that the one of us was
again to see him face to face.&nbsp; So sweet and winning was his
nature that his slightest wish was our law&mdash;and whenever we 
pleased him, no matter how little, he never failed to thank us as
though we had done him <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>a service which we should have had a 
perfect right to withhold.&nbsp; How proud were we upon any of 
these occasions, and how we courted the opportunity of being 
thanked!&nbsp; He did indeed well know the art of becoming 
idolised by his children, and dearly did he prize the results of 
his own proficiency; yet truly there was no art about it; all 
arose spontaneously from the well-spring of a sympathetic nature 
which was quick to feel as others felt, whether old or young, 
rich or poor, wise or foolish.&nbsp; On one point alone did he 
neglect us&mdash;I refer to our religious education.&nbsp; On all
other matters he was the kindest and most careful teacher in the 
world.&nbsp; Love and gratitude be to his memory!</p>
<p>My mother loved us no less ardently than my father, but she 
was of a quicker temper, and less adept at conciliating 
affection.&nbsp; She must have been exceedingly handsome when she
was young, and was still comely when we first remembered her; she
was also highly accomplished, but she felt my father&rsquo;s loss
of fortune more keenly than my father himself, and it preyed upon
her mind, though rather for our sake than for her own.&nbsp; Had 
we not known my father we should have loved her better than any 
one in the world, but affection goes by comparison, and my father
spoiled us for any one but himself; indeed, in after life, I 
remember my mother&rsquo;s telling me, with many tears, how 
jealous she had often been of the love we bore him, and how mean 
she had thought it of him to entrust all scolding or repression 
to her, so that he might have more than his due share of our 
affection.&nbsp; Not that I believe my father did this 
consciously; still, he so greatly hated scolding that I dare say 
we might often have got off scot-free when we really deserved 
reproof <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>had not my mother undertaken the 
<i>onus</i> of scolding us herself.&nbsp; We therefore naturally 
feared her more than my father, and fearing more we loved 
less.&nbsp; For as love casteth out fear, so fear love.</p>
<p>This must have been hard to bear, and my mother scarcely knew 
the way to bear it.&nbsp; She tried to upbraid us, in little 
ways, into loving her as much as my father; the more she tried 
this, the less we could succeed in doing it; and so on and so on 
in a fashion which need not be detailed.&nbsp; Not but what we 
really loved her deeply, while her affection for us was 
insurpassable; still we loved her less than we loved my father, 
and this was the grievance.</p>
<p>My father entrusted our religious education entirely to my 
mother.&nbsp; He was himself, I am assured, of a deeply religious
turn of mind, and a thoroughly consistent member of the Church of
England; but he conceived, and perhaps rightly, that it is the 
mother who should first teach her children to lift their hands in
prayer, and impart to them a knowledge of the One in whom we live
and move and have our being.&nbsp; My mother accepted the task 
gladly, for in spite of a certain narrowness of view&mdash;the 
natural but deplorable result of her earlier 
surroundings&mdash;she was one of the most truly pious women whom
I have ever known; unfortunately for herself and us she had been 
trained in the lowest school of Evangelical literalism&mdash;a 
school which in after life both my brother and myself came to 
regard as the main obstacle to the complete overthrow of 
unbelief; we therefore looked upon it with something stronger 
than aversion, and for my own part I still deem it perhaps the 
most insidious enemy which the cause of Christ has ever 
encountered.&nbsp; But of this more hereafter.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>My mother, as I said, threw her whole soul into the work
of our religious education.&nbsp; Whatever she believed she 
believed literally, and, if I may say so, with a harshness of 
realisation which left little scope for imagination or 
mystery.&nbsp; Her ideas concerning heaven and her solutions of 
life&rsquo;s enigmas were clear and simple, but they could only 
be reconciled with certain obvious facts&mdash;such as the 
omnipotence and all-goodness of God&mdash;by leaving many things 
absolutely out of sight.&nbsp; And this my mother succeeded 
effectually in doing.&nbsp; She never doubted that her opinions 
comprised the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; 
she therefore made haste to sow the good seed in our tender 
minds, and so far succeeded that when my brother was four years 
old he could repeat the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, the general 
confession, and the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer without a blunder.&nbsp; 
My mother made herself believe that he delighted in them; but, 
alas! it was far otherwise; for strange as it may appear 
concerning one whose later life was a continual prayer, in 
childhood he detested nothing so much as being made to pray, and 
to learn his catechism.&nbsp; In this I am sorry to say we were 
both heartily of a mind.&nbsp; As for Sunday the less said the 
better.</p>
<p>I have already hinted (but as a warning to other parents had 
better, perhaps, express myself more plainly) that this aversion 
was probably the result of my mother&rsquo;s undue eagerness to 
reap an artificial fruit of lip-service, which could have little 
meaning to the heart of one so young.&nbsp; I believe that the 
severe check which the natural growth of faith experienced in my 
brother&rsquo;s case was due almost entirely to this cause, and 
to the school of literalism in which he had been trained; but, 
however this may be, we both of us hated being made <!-- page 
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>to 
say our prayers.&nbsp; Morning and evening it was our one 
bugbear, and we would avoid it, as indeed children generally 
will, by every artifice which we could employ.</p>
<p>Thus we were in the habit of feigning to be asleep shortly 
before prayer time, and would gratefully hear my father tell my 
mother that it was a shame to wake us; whereon he would carry us 
up to bed in a state apparently of the profoundest slumber when 
we were really wide awake and in great fear of detection.&nbsp; 
For we knew how to pretend to be asleep, but we did not know how 
we ought to wake again; there was nothing for it therefore when 
we were once committed, but to go on sleeping till we were fairly
undressed and put to bed, and could wake up safely in the 
dark.&nbsp; But deceit is never long successful, and we were at 
last ignominiously exposed.</p>
<p>It happened one evening that my mother suspected my brother 
John, and tried to open his little hands which were lying clasped
in front of him.&nbsp; Now my brother was as yet very crude and 
inconsistent in his theories concerning sleep, and had no 
conception what a real sleeper would do under these 
circumstances.&nbsp; Fear deprived him of his powers of 
reflection, and he thus unfortunately concluded that because 
sleepers, so far as he had observed them, were always motionless,
therefore they must be rigid and incapable of motion; and indeed 
that any movement, under any circumstances (for from his earliest
childhood he liked to carry his theories to their legitimate 
conclusion), would be physically impossible for one who was 
really sleeping; forgetful, oh! unhappy one, of the flexibility 
of his own body on being carried up stairs, and, more unhappy 
still, ignorant of the art of waking.&nbsp; He therefore <!-- 
page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
53</span>clenched his fingers harder and harder as he felt my 
mother trying to unfold them, while his head hung listless, and 
his eyes were closed as though he were sleeping sweetly.&nbsp; It
is needless to detail the agony of shame that followed.&nbsp; My 
mother begged my father to box his ears, which my father flatly 
refused to do.&nbsp; Then she boxed them herself, and there 
followed a scene, and a day or two of disgrace for both of 
us.</p>
<p>Shortly after this there happened another misadventure.&nbsp; 
A lady came to stay with my mother, and was to sleep in a bed 
that had been brought into our nursery, for my father&rsquo;s 
fortunes had already failed, and we were living in a humble 
way.&nbsp; We were still but four and five years old, so the 
arrangement was not unnatural, and it was assumed that we should 
be asleep before the lady went to bed, and be down stairs before 
she would get up in the morning.&nbsp; But the arrival of this 
lady and her being put to sleep in the nursery were great events 
to us in those days, and being particularly wanted to go to 
sleep, we of course sat up in bed talking and keeping ourselves 
awake till she should come up stairs.&nbsp; Perhaps we had 
fancied that she would give us something, but if so we were 
disappointed.&nbsp; However, whether this was the case or not, we
were wide awake when our visitor came to bed, and having no 
particular object to gain, we made no pretence of sleeping.&nbsp;
The lady kissed us both, told us to lie still and go to sleep 
like good children, and then began doing her hair.</p>
<p>I remember this was the occasion on which my brother 
discovered a good many things in connection with the fair sex 
which had hitherto been beyond his ken; more especially that the 
mass of petticoats and clothes which envelop the female form were
not, as he <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>expressed it to me, &ldquo;all solid 
woman,&rdquo; but that women were not in reality more 
substantially built than men, and had legs as much as he 
had&mdash;a fact which he had never yet realised.&nbsp; On this 
he for a long time considered them as impostors, who had wronged 
him by leading him to suppose that they had far more &ldquo;body 
in them&rdquo; (so he said) than he now found they had.</p>
<p>This was a sort of thing which he regarded with stern moral 
reprobation.&nbsp; If he had been old enough to have a solicitor 
I believe he would have put the matter into his hands, as well as
certain other things which had lately troubled him.&nbsp; For but
recently my mother had bought a fowl, and he had seen it plucked,
and the inside taken out; his irritation had been extreme on 
discovering that fowls were not all solid flesh, but that their 
insides&mdash;and these formed, as it appeared to him, an 
enormous percentage of the bird&mdash;were perfectly 
useless.&nbsp; He was now beginning to understand that sheep and 
cows were also hollow as far as good meat was concerned; the 
flesh they had was only a mouthful in comparison with what they 
ought to have considering their apparent bulk: insignificant, 
mere skin and bone covering a cavern.&nbsp; What right had they, 
or anything else, to assert themselves as so big, and prove so 
empty?&nbsp; And now this discovery of woman&rsquo;s falsehood 
was quite too much for him.&nbsp; The world itself was hollow, 
made up of shams and delusions, full of sound and fury signifying
nothing.</p>
<p>Truly a prosaic young gentleman enough.&nbsp; Everything with 
him was to be exactly in all its parts what it appeared on the 
face of it, and everything was to go on doing exactly what it had
been doing hitherto.&nbsp; <!-- page 55--><a 
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>If a thing 
looked solid, it was to be very solid; if hollow, very hollow; 
nothing was to be half and half, and nothing was to change unless
he had himself already become accustomed to its times and manners
of changing; there were to be no exceptions and no 
contradictions; all things were to be perfectly consistent, and 
all premisses to be carried with extremest rigour to their 
legitimate conclusions.&nbsp; Heaven was to be very neat (for he 
was always tidy himself), and free from sudden shocks to the 
nervous system, such as those caused by dogs barking at him, or 
cows driven in the streets.&nbsp; God was to resemble my father, 
and the Holy Spirit to bear some sort of indistinct analogy to my
mother.</p>
<p>Such were the ideal theories of his 
childhood&mdash;unconsciously formed, but very firmly believed 
in.&nbsp; As he grew up he made such modifications as were forced
upon him by enlarged perceptions, but every modification was an 
effort to him, in spite of a continual and successful resistance 
to what he recognised as his initial mental defect.</p>
<p>I may perhaps be allowed to say here, in reference to a remark
in the preceding paragraph, that both my brother and myself used 
to notice it as an almost invariable rule that children&rsquo;s 
earliest ideas of God are modelled upon the character of their 
father&mdash;if they have one.&nbsp; Should the father be kind, 
considerate, full of the warmest love, fond of showing it, and 
reserved only about his displeasure, the child, having learned to
look upon God as his Heavenly Father through the Lord&rsquo;s 
Prayer and our Church Services, will feel towards God as he does 
towards his own father; this conception will stick to a man for 
years and years after he has attained manhood&mdash;probably it 
<!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>will never leave him.&nbsp; On the other hand, if a man 
has found his earthly father harsh and uncongenial, his 
conception of his Heavenly Parent will be painful.&nbsp; He will 
begin by seeing God as an exaggerated likeness of his 
father.&nbsp; He will therefore shrink from Him.&nbsp; The 
rottenness of still-born love in the heart of a child poisons the
blood of the soul, and hence, later, crime.</p>
<p>To return, however, to the lady.&nbsp; When she had put on her
night-gown, she knelt down by her bed-side and, to our 
consternation, began to say her prayers.&nbsp; This was a cruel 
blow to both of us; we had always been under the impression that 
grown-up people were not made to say their prayers, and the idea 
of any one saying them of his or her own accord had never 
occurred to us as possible.&nbsp; Of course the lady would not 
say her prayers if she were not obliged; and yet she did say 
them; therefore she must be obliged to say them; therefore we 
should be obliged to say them, and this was a great 
disappointment.&nbsp; Awe-struck and open-mouthed we listened 
while the lady prayed aloud and with a good deal of pathos for 
many virtues and blessings which I do not now remember, and 
finally for my father and mother and for both of us&mdash;shortly
afterwards she rose, blew out the light and got into bed.&nbsp; 
Every word that she said had confirmed our worst apprehensions: 
it was just what we had been taught to say ourselves.</p>
<p>Next morning we compared notes and drew some painful 
inferences; but in the course of the day our spirits 
rallied.&nbsp; We agreed that there were many mysteries in 
connection with life and things which it was high time to 
unravel, and that an opportunity was now afforded us which might 
not readily occur again.&nbsp; <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>All we had to
do was to be true to ourselves and equal to the occasion.&nbsp; 
We laid our plans with great astuteness.&nbsp; We would be fast 
asleep when the lady came up to bed, but our heads should be 
turned in the direction of her bed, and covered with clothes, all
but a single peep-hole.&nbsp; My brother, as the eldest, had 
clearly a right to be nearest the lady, but I could see 
sufficiently, and could depend on his reporting faithfully 
whatever should escape me.</p>
<p>There was no chance of her giving us anything&mdash;if she had
meant to do so she would have done it sooner; she might, indeed, 
consider the moment of her departure as the most auspicious for 
this purpose, but then she was not going yet, and the interval 
was at our own disposal.&nbsp; We spent the afternoon in trying 
to learn to snore, but we were not certain about it, and in the 
end concluded that as snoring was not <i>de rigueur</i> we had 
better dispense with it.</p>
<p>We were put to bed; the light was taken away; we were told to 
go to sleep, and promised faithfully that we would do so; the 
tongue indeed swore, but the mind was unsworn.&nbsp; It was 
agreed that we should keep pinching one another to prevent our 
going to sleep.&nbsp; We did so at frequent intervals; at last 
our patience was rewarded with the heavy creak, as of a stout 
elderly lady labouring up the stairs, and presently our victim 
entered.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, the lady on satisfying herself that
we were asleep, never said her prayers at all; during the 
remainder of her visit whenever she found us awake she always 
said them, but when she thought we were asleep, she never 
prayed.&nbsp; I should perhaps say that we had the matter out 
with her before she left, and that the consequences were <!-- 
page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
58</span>unpleasant for all parties; they added to the troubles 
in which we were already involved as to our prayers, and were 
indirectly among the earliest causes which led my brother to look
with scepticism upon religion.</p>
<p>For awhile, however, all went on as though nothing had 
happened.&nbsp; An effect of distrust, indeed, remained after the
cause had been forgotten, but my brother was still too young to 
oppose anything that my mother told him, and to all outward 
appearance he grew in grace no less rapidly than in stature.</p>
<p>For years we led a quiet and eventless life, broken only by 
the one great sorrow of our father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Shortly 
after this we were sent to a day school in Bloomsbury.&nbsp; We 
were neither of us very happy there, but my brother, who always 
took kindly to his books, picked up a fair knowledge of Latin and
Greek; he also learned to draw, and to exercise himself a little 
in English composition.&nbsp; When I was about fourteen my mother
capitalised a part of her income and started me off to America, 
where she had friends who could give me a helping hand; by their 
kindness I was enabled, after an absence of twenty years, to 
return with a handsome income, but not, alas! before the death of
my mother.</p>
<p>Up to the time of my departure my mother continued to read the
Bible with us and explain it.&nbsp; She had become enamoured of 
those millenarian opinions which laid hold of so many some 
twenty-five or thirty years ago.&nbsp; The Apocalypse was perhaps
her favourite book in the Bible, and she was imbued with a 
conviction that all the many and varied horrors with which it 
teems were upon the eve of their accomplishment.&nbsp; The year 
eighteen hundred and forty-eight was to be (as indeed it was) a 
time of general bloodshed and confusion, <!-- page 59--><a 
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>while in 
eighteen hundred and sixty-six, should it please God to spare 
her, her eyes would be gladdened by the visible descent of the 
Son of Man with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, with 
the trump of God, and the dead in Christ should rise first; then 
she, as one of them that were alive, would be caught up with 
other saints into the air, and would possibly receive while 
rising some distinguishing token of confidence and approbation 
which should fall with due impressiveness upon the surrounding 
multitude; then would come the consummation of all things, and 
she would be ever with the Lord.&nbsp; She died peaceably in her 
bed before she could know that a commercial panic was the nearest
approach to the fulfilment of prophecy which the year eighteen 
hundred and sixty-six brought forth.</p>
<p>These opinions of my mother&rsquo;s injured her naturally 
healthy and vigorous mind by leading her to indulge in all manner
of dreamy and fanciful interpretations of Scripture, which any 
but the most narrow literalist would feel at once to be 
untenable.&nbsp; Thus several times she expressed to us her 
conviction that my brother and myself were to be the two 
witnesses mentioned in the eleventh chapter of the Book of 
Revelation, and dilated upon the gratification she should 
experience upon finding that we had indeed been reserved for a 
position of such distinction.&nbsp; We were as yet mere children,
and naturally took all for granted that our mother told us; we 
therefore made a careful examination of the passage which threw 
light upon our future.&nbsp; On finding that the prospect was 
gloomy and full of bloodshed we protested against the honours 
which were intended for us, more especially when we reflected 
that the mother of the two witnesses was not menaced in <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>Scripture with any particular discomfort.&nbsp; If we 
were to be martyrs, my mother ought to wish to be a martyr too, 
whereas nothing was farther from her intention.&nbsp; Her notion 
clearly was that we were to be massacred somewhere in the streets
of London, in consequence of the anti-Christian machinations of 
the Pope; that after lying about unburied for three days and a 
half we were to come to life again; and finally, that we should 
conspicuously ascend to heaven, in front, perhaps, of the 
Foundling Hospital.</p>
<p>She was not herself indeed to share either our martyrdom or 
our glorification, but was to survive us many years on earth, 
living in an odour of great sanctity and reflected splendour, as 
the central and most august figure in a select society.&nbsp; She
would perhaps be able indirectly, through her sons&rsquo; 
influence with the Almighty, to have a voice in most of the 
arrangements both of this world and of the next.&nbsp; If all 
this were to come true (and things seemed very like it), those 
friends who had neglected us in our adversity would not find it 
too easy to be restored to favour, however greatly they might 
desire it&mdash;that is to say, they would not have found it too 
easy in the case of one less magnanimous and spiritually-minded 
than herself.&nbsp; My mother said but little of the above 
directly, but the fragments which occasionally escaped her were 
pregnant, and on looking back it is easy to perceive that she 
must have been building one of the most stupendous a&euml;rial 
fabrics that have ever been reared.</p>
<p>I have given the above in its more amusing aspect, and am half
afraid that I may appear to be making a jest of weakness on the 
part of one of the most devotedly unselfish mothers who have ever
existed.&nbsp; But one can love while smiling, and the very 
wildness of <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>my mother&rsquo;s dream serves to 
show how entirely her whole soul was occupied with the things 
which are above.&nbsp; To her, religion was all in all; the earth
was but a place of pilgrimage&mdash;only so far important as it 
was a possible road to heaven.&nbsp; She impressed this upon both
of us by every word and action&mdash;instant in season and out of
season, so that she might but fill us more deeply with a sense of
the things belonging to our peace.</p>
<p>But the inevitable consequences happened; my mother had aimed 
too high and had overshot her mark.&nbsp; The influence indeed of
her guileless and unworldly nature remained impressed upon my 
brother even during the time of his extremest unbelief (perhaps 
his ultimate safety is in the main referable to this cause, and 
to the happy memories of my father, which had predisposed him to 
love God), but my mother had insisted on the most minute verbal 
accuracy of every part of the Bible; she had also dwelt upon the 
duty of independent research, and on the necessity of giving up 
everything rather than assent to things which our conscience did 
not assent to.&nbsp; No one could have more effectually taught us
to try <i>to think</i> the truth, and we had taken her at her 
word because our hearts told us that she was right.&nbsp; But she
required three incompatible things.&nbsp; When my brother grew 
older he came to feel that independent and unflinching 
examination, with a determination to abide by the results, would 
lead him to reject the point which to my mother was more 
important than any other&mdash;I mean the absolute accuracy of 
the Gospel records.&nbsp; My mother was inexpressibly shocked at 
hearing my brother doubt the authenticity of the Epistle to the 
Hebrews; and then, as it appeared to him, she tried to make him 
<!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>violate the duties of examination and candour which he 
had learnt too thoroughly to unlearn.&nbsp; Thereon came pain and
an estrangement which was none the less profound for being 
mutually concealed.&nbsp; It seemed to my mother that he would 
not give up the wilfulness of his own opinions for her and for 
his Redeemer&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; To him it seemed that he was 
ready to give up not only his mother but Christ Himself for 
Christ&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>This estrangement was the gradual work of some five or six 
years, during which my brother was between eleven and seventeen 
years old.&nbsp; At seventeen, I am told that he was remarkably 
well informed and clever.&nbsp; His manners were, like my 
father&rsquo;s, singularly genial, and his appearance very 
prepossessing.&nbsp; He had as yet no doubt concerning the 
soundness of any fundamental Christian doctrine, but his mind was
already too active to allow of his being contented with my 
mother&rsquo;s childlike faith.&nbsp; There were points on which 
he did not indeed doubt, but which it would none the less be 
interesting to consider; such for example as the perfectibility 
of the regenerate Christian, and the meaning of the mysterious 
central chapters of the Epistle to the Romans.&nbsp; He was 
engaged in these researches though still only a boy, when an 
event occurred which gave the first real shock to his faith.</p>
<p>He was accustomed to teach in a school for the poorest 
children every Sunday afternoon, a task for which his patience 
and good temper well fitted him.&nbsp; On one occasion, however, 
while he was explaining the effect of baptism to one of his 
favourite pupils, he discovered to his great surprise that the 
boy had never been baptized.&nbsp; He pushed his inquiries 
further, and found that out of the fifteen boys in his class only
five had been baptized, and, not only so, but that no difference 
<!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>in disposition or conduct could be discovered between 
the regenerate boys and the unregenerate.&nbsp; The good and bad 
boys were distributed in proportions equal to the respective 
numbers of the baptized and unbaptized.&nbsp; In spite of a 
certain impetuosity of natural character, he was also of a 
matter-of-fact and experimental turn of mind; he therefore went 
through the whole school, which numbered about a hundred boys, 
and found out who had been baptized and who had not.&nbsp; The 
same results appeared.&nbsp; The majority had not been baptized; 
yet the good and bad dispositions were so distributed as to 
preclude all possibility of maintaining that the baptized boys 
were better than the unbaptized.</p>
<p>The reader may smile at the idea of any one&rsquo;s faith 
being troubled by a fact of which the explanation is so obvious, 
but as a matter of fact my brother was seriously and painfully 
shocked.&nbsp; The teacher to whom he applied for a solution of 
the difficulty was not a man of any real power, and reported my 
brother to the rector for having disturbed the school by his 
inquiries.&nbsp; The rector was old and self-opinionated; the 
difficulty, indeed, was plainly as new to him as it had been to 
my brother, but instead of saying so at once, and referring to 
any recognised theological authority, he tried to put him off 
with words which seemed intended to silence him rather than to 
satisfy him; finally he lost his temper, and my brother fell 
under suspicion of unorthodoxy.</p>
<p>This kind of treatment did not answer with my brother.&nbsp; 
He alludes to it resentfully in the introductory chapter of his 
book.&nbsp; He became suspicious that a preconceived opinion was 
being defended at the expense of honest scrutiny, and was thus 
driven upon <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>his own unaided investigation.&nbsp; 
The result may be guessed: he began to go astray, and strayed 
further and further.&nbsp; The children of God, he reasoned, the 
members of Christ and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven, were 
no more spiritually minded than the children of the world and the
devil.&nbsp; Was then the grace of God a gift which left no trace
whatever upon those who were possessed of it?&nbsp; A thing the 
presence or absence of which might be ascertained by consulting 
the parish registry, but was not discernible in conduct?&nbsp; 
The grace of man was more clearly perceptible than this.&nbsp; 
Assuredly there must be a screw loose somewhere, which, for aught
he knew, might be jeopardising the salvation of all 
Christendom.&nbsp; Where then was this loose screw to be 
found?</p>
<p>He concluded after some months of reflection that the mischief
was caused by the system of sponsors and by infant baptism.&nbsp;
He, therefore, to my mother&rsquo;s inexpressible grief, joined 
the Baptists, and was immersed in a pond near Dorking.&nbsp; With
the Baptists he remained quiet about three months, and then began
to quarrel with his instructors as to their doctrine of 
predestination.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards he came accidentally 
upon a fascinating stranger who was no less struck with my 
brother than my brother with him, and this gentleman, who turned 
out to be a Roman Catholic missionary, landed him in the Church 
of Rome, where he felt sure that he had now found rest for his 
soul.&nbsp; But here, too, he was mistaken; after about two years
he rebelled against the stifling of all free inquiry; on this 
rebellion the flood-gates of scepticism were opened, and he was 
soon battling with unbelief.&nbsp; He then fell in with one who 
was a pure Deist, and was shorn of every shred of dogma which he 
had ever held, except <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>a belief in the personality and 
providence of the Creator.</p>
<p>On reviewing his letters written to me about this time, I am 
painfully struck with the manner in which they show that all 
these pitiable vagaries were to be traced to a single 
cause&mdash;a cause which still exists to the misleading of 
hundreds of thousands, and which, I fear, seems likely to 
continue in full force for many a year to come&mdash;I mean, to a
false system of training which teaches people to regard 
Christianity as a thing one and indivisible, to be accepted 
entirely in the strictest reading of the letter, or to be 
rejected as absolutely untrue.&nbsp; The fact is, that all 
permanent truth is as one of those coal measures, a seam of which
lies near the surface, and even crops up above the ground, but 
which is generally of an inferior quality and soon worked out; 
beneath it there comes a labour of sand and clay, and then at 
last the true seam of precious quality, and in virtually 
inexhaustible supply.&nbsp; The truth which is on the surface is 
rarely the whole truth.&nbsp; It is seldom until this has been 
worked out and done with&mdash;as in the case of the apparent 
flatness of the earth&mdash;that unchangeable truth is 
discovered.&nbsp; It is the glory of the Lord to conceal a 
matter: it is the glory of the king to find it out.&nbsp; If my 
brother, from whom I have taken the above illustration, had had 
some judicious and wide-minded friend, to correct and supplement 
the mainly admirable principles which had been instilled into him
by my mother, he would have been saved years of spiritual 
wandering; but, as it was, he fell in with one after another, 
each in his own way as literal and unspiritual as the 
other&mdash;each impressed with one aspect of religious truth, 
and with one only.&nbsp; In the end he became perhaps the 
widest-minded <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>and most original thinker whom I have
ever met; but no one from his early manhood could have augured 
this result; on the contrary, he showed every sign of being 
likely to develop into one of those who can never see more than 
one side of a question at a time, in spite of their seeing that 
side with singular clearness of mental vision.&nbsp; In after 
life, he often met with mere lads who seemed to him to be years 
and years in advance of what he had been at their age, and would 
say, smiling, &ldquo;With a great sum obtained I this freedom; 
but thou wast free-born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet when one comes to think of it, a late development and 
laborious growth are generally more fruitful than those which are
over early luxuriant.&nbsp; Drawing an illustration from the art 
of painting, with which he was well acquainted, my brother used 
to say that all the greatest painters had begun with a hard and 
precise manner, from which they had only broken after several 
years of effort; and that in like manner all the early schools 
were founded upon definiteness of outline to the exclusion of 
truth of effect.&nbsp; This may be true; but in my 
brother&rsquo;s case there was something even more unpromising 
than this; there was a commonness, so to speak, of mental 
execution, from which no one could have foreseen his 
after-emancipation.&nbsp; Yet in the course of time he was indeed
emancipated to the very uttermost, while his bonds will, I firmly
trust, be found to have been of inestimable service to the whole 
human race.</p>
<p>For although it was so many years before he was enabled to see
the Christian scheme <i>as a whole</i>, or even to conceive the 
idea that there was any whole at all, other than each one of the 
stages of opinion through which he was at the time passing; yet 
when <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>the idea was at length presented to him by one whom I 
must not name, the discarded fragments of his faith assumed 
shape, and formed themselves into a consistently organised 
scheme.&nbsp; Then became apparent the value of his knowledge of 
the details of so many different sides of Christian verity.&nbsp;
Buried in the details, he had hitherto ignored the fact that they
were only the unessential developments of certain component 
parts.&nbsp; Awakening to the perception of the whole after an 
intimate acquaintance with the details, he was able to realise 
the position and meaning of all that he had hitherto experienced 
in a way which has been vouchsafed to few, if any others.&nbsp; 
Thus he became truly a broad Churchman.&nbsp; Not broad in the 
ordinary and ill-considered use of the term (for the broad 
Churchman is as little able to sympathise with Romanists, extreme
High Churchmen and Dissenters, as these are with himself&mdash;he
is only one of a sect which is called by the name of broad, 
though it is no broader than its own base), but in the true sense
of being able to believe in the naturalness, legitimacy, and 
truth <i>qu&acirc;</i> Christianity even of those doctrines which
seem to stand most widely and irreconcilably asunder.</p>

68</span>SELECTIONS FROM LIFE AND HABIT.</h2>
<h3>ON CERTAIN ACQUIRED HABITS.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">from 
chapter i. of life and habit</span>.) <a name="citation68"></a><a
href="#footnote68" class="citation">[68]</a></h3>
<p>It will be our business in the following chapters to consider 
whether the unconsciousness, or quasi-unconsciousness, with which
we perform certain acquired actions, throws any light upon 
Embryology and inherited instincts, and otherwise to follow the 
train of thought which the class of actions above mentioned may 
suggest.&nbsp; More especially I propose to consider them in so 
far as they bear upon the origin of species and the continuation 
of life by successive generations, whether in the animal or 
vegetable kingdoms.</p>
<p>Taking then, the art of playing the piano as an example of the
kind of action we are in search of, we observe that a practised 
player will perform very difficult pieces apparently without 
effort, often, indeed, while thinking and talking of something 
quite other than his music; yet he will play accurately and, 
possibly, with much expression.&nbsp; If he has been playing a 
fugue, say in four parts, he will have kept each part well 
distinct, in such a manner as to prove that his mind was not 
prevented, by its other occupations, from consciously or 
unconsciously following four distinct trains of musical thought 
at the same time, nor <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>from making his fingers act in 
exactly the required manner as regards each note of each 
part.</p>
<p>It commonly happens that in the course of four or five minutes
a player may have struck four or five thousand notes.&nbsp; If we
take into consideration the rests, dotted notes, accidentals, 
variations of time, &amp;c., we shall find his attention must 
have been exercised on many more occasions than when he was 
actually striking notes: so that it may not be too much to say 
that the attention of a first-rate player has been 
exercised&mdash;to an infinitesimally small extent&mdash;but 
still truly exercised&mdash;on as many as ten thousand occasions 
within the space of five minutes, for no note can be struck nor 
point attended to without a certain amount of attention, no 
matter how rapidly or unconsciously given.</p>
<p>Moreover, each act of attention has been followed by an act of
volition, and each act of volition by a muscular action, which is
composed of many minor actions; some so small that we can no more
follow them than the player himself can perceive them; 
nevertheless, it may have been perfectly plain that the player 
was not attending to what he was doing, but was listening to 
conversation on some other subject, not to say joining in it 
himself.&nbsp; If he has been playing the violin, he may have 
done all the above, and may also have been walking about.&nbsp; 
Herr Joachim would unquestionably be able to do all that has here
been described.</p>
<p>So complete may be the player&rsquo;s unconsciousness of the 
attention he is giving, and the brain power he is exerting, that 
we may find it difficult to awaken his attention to any 
particular part of his performance without putting him out.&nbsp;
Indeed we cannot do so.&nbsp; <!-- page 70--><a 
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>We observe 
that he finds it hardly less difficult to compass a voluntary 
consciousness of what he has once learnt so thoroughly that it 
has passed, so to speak, into the domain of unconsciousness, than
he found it to learn the note or passage in the first 
instance.&nbsp; The effort after a second consciousness of detail
baffles him&mdash;compels him to turn to his music or play 
slowly.&nbsp; In fact it seems as though he knows the piece too 
well to be able to know that he knows it, and is only conscious 
of knowing those passages which he does not know so 
thoroughly.</p>
<p>At the end of his performance, his power of recollecting 
appears to be no less annihilated than was his consciousness of 
attention and volition.&nbsp; For of the thousands of acts 
requiring the exercise of both the one and the other, which he 
has done during the five minutes, we will say, of his 
performance, he will remember hardly one when it is over.&nbsp; 
If he calls to mind anything beyond the main fact that he has 
played such and such a piece, it will probably be some passage 
which he has found more difficult than the others, and with the 
like of which he has not been so long familiar.&nbsp; All the 
rest he will forget as completely as the breath which he has 
drawn while playing.</p>
<p>He finds it difficult to remember even the difficulties he 
experienced in learning to play.&nbsp; A few may have so 
impressed him that they remain with him, but the greater part 
will have escaped him as completely as the remembrance of what he
ate, or how he put on his clothes, this day ten years ago; 
nevertheless, it is plain he does in reality remember more than 
he remembers remembering, for he avoids mistakes which he made at
one time, and his performance proves that <!-- page 71--><a 
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>all the notes
are in his memory, though if called upon to play such and such a 
bar at random from the middle of the piece, and neither more nor 
less, he will probably say that he cannot remember it unless he 
begins from the beginning of the phrase which leads to it.</p>
<p>In spite, however, of the performer&rsquo;s present 
proficiency, our experience of the manner in which proficiency is
usually acquired warrants us in assuming that there must have 
been a time when what is now so easy as to be done without 
conscious effort of the brain was only done by means of brain 
work which was very keenly perceived, even to fatigue and 
positive distress.&nbsp; Even now, if the player is playing 
something the like of which he has not met before, we observe he 
pauses and becomes immediately conscious of attention.</p>
<p>We draw the inference, therefore, as regards pianoforte or 
violin playing, that the more the familiarity or knowledge of the
art, the less is there consciousness of such knowledge; even so 
far as that there should be almost as much difficulty in 
awakening consciousness which has become, so to speak, 
latent,&mdash;a consciousness of that which is known too well to 
admit of recognised self-analysis while the knowledge is being 
exercised&mdash;as in creating a consciousness of that which is 
not yet well enough known to be properly designated as known at 
all.&nbsp; On the other hand, we observe that the less the 
familiarity or knowledge, the greater the consciousness of 
whatever knowledge there is.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>To sum up, then, briefly.&nbsp; It would appear as though 
perfect knowledge and perfect ignorance were extremes which meet 
and become indistinguishable from one another; so also perfect 
volition and perfect <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>absence of volition, perfect memory 
and perfect forgetfulness; for we are unconscious of knowing, 
willing, or remembering, either from not yet having known or 
willed, or from knowing and willing so well and so intensely as 
to be no longer conscious of either.&nbsp; Conscious knowledge 
and volition are of attention; attention is of suspense; suspense
is of doubt; doubt is of uncertainty; uncertainty is of 
ignorance; so that the mere fact of conscious knowing or willing 
implies the presence of more or less novelty and doubt.</p>
<p>It would also appear as a general principle on a superficial 
view of the foregoing instances (and the reader may readily 
supply himself with others which are perhaps more to the 
purpose), that unconscious knowledge and unconscious volition are
never acquired otherwise than as the result of experience, 
familiarity, or habit; so that whenever we observe a person able 
to do any complicated action unconsciously, we may assume both 
that he must have done it very often before he could acquire so 
great proficiency, and also that there must have been a time when
he did not know how to do it at all.</p>
<p>We may assume that there was a time when he was yet so nearly 
on the point of neither knowing nor willing perfectly, that he 
was quite alive to whatever knowledge or volition he could exert;
going further back, we shall find him still more keenly alive to 
a less perfect knowledge; earlier still, we find him well aware 
that he does not know nor will correctly, but trying hard to do 
both the one and the other; and so on, back and back, till both 
difficulty and consciousness become little more than &ldquo;a 
sound of going,&rdquo; as it were, in the brain, a flitting to 
and fro of something barely recognisable as the desire to will or
know at all&mdash;much <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>less as the desire to know or will 
definitely this or that.&nbsp; Finally they retreat beyond our 
ken into the repose&mdash;the inorganic kingdom&mdash;of as yet 
unawakened interest.</p>
<p>In either case&mdash;the repose of perfect ignorance or of 
perfect knowledge&mdash;disturbance is troublesome.&nbsp; When 
first starting on an Atlantic steamer, our rest is hindered by 
the screw; after a short time, it is hindered if the screw 
stops.&nbsp; A uniform impression is practically no 
impression.&nbsp; One cannot either learn or unlearn without 
pains or pain.</p>
<h3><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS KNOWERS THE LAW AND 
GRACE.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">from chapter ii. of life and 
habit</span>.)</h3>
<p>Certain it is that we know best what we are least conscious of
knowing, or at any rate least able to prove; as, for example, our
own existence, or that there is a country England.&nbsp; If any 
one asks us for proof on matters of this sort, we have none 
ready, and are justly annoyed at being called to consider what we
regard as settled questions.&nbsp; Again, there is hardly 
anything which so much affects our actions as the centre of the 
earth (unless, perhaps, it be that still hotter and more 
unprofitable spot the centre of the universe), for we are 
incessantly trying to get as near it as circumstances will allow,
or to avoid getting nearer than is for the time being 
convenient.&nbsp; Walking, running, standing, sitting, lying, 
waking, or sleeping, from birth till death it is a paramount 
object with us; even after death&mdash;if it be not fanciful to 
say so&mdash;it is one of the few things of which what is left of
us can still feel the influence; yet what can engross less of our
attention than this dark and distant spot so many thousands of 
miles away?</p>
<p>The air we breathe, so long as it is neither too hot nor cold,
nor rough, nor full of smoke&mdash;that is to say, so long as it 
is in that state with which we are best <!-- page 75--><a 
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
75</span>acquainted&mdash;seldom enters into our thoughts; yet 
there is hardly anything with which we are more incessantly 
occupied night and day.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not too much to say that we have no really 
profound knowledge upon any subject&mdash;no knowledge on the 
strength of which we are ready to act at moments unhesitatingly 
without either preparation or after-thought&mdash;till we have 
left off feeling conscious of the possession of such knowledge, 
and of the grounds on which it rests.&nbsp; A lesson thoroughly 
learned must be like the air which feels so light, though 
pressing so heavily against us, because every pore of our skin is
saturated, so to speak, with it on all sides equally.&nbsp; This 
perfection of knowledge sometimes extends to positive disbelief 
in the thing known, so that the most thorough knower shall 
believe himself altogether ignorant.&nbsp; No thief, for example,
is such an utter thief&mdash;so <i>good</i> a thief&mdash;as the 
kleptomaniac.&nbsp; Until he has become a kleptomaniac, and can 
steal a horse as it were by a reflex action, he is still but half
a thief, with many unthievish notions still clinging to 
him.&nbsp; Yet the kleptomaniac is probably unaware that he can 
steal at all, much less that he can steal so well.&nbsp; He would
be shocked if he were to know the truth.&nbsp; So again, no man 
is a great hypocrite until he has left off knowing that he is a 
hypocrite.&nbsp; The great hypocrites of the world are almost 
invariably under the impression that they are among the very few 
really honest people to be found; and, as we must all have 
observed, it is rare to find any one strongly under this 
impression without ourselves having good reason to differ from 
him.</p>
<p>Again, it has been often and very truly said that it is not 
the conscious and self-styled sceptic, as Shelley, <!-- page 
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>for 
example, who is the true unbeliever.&nbsp; Such a man as Shelley 
will, as indeed his life abundantly proves, have more in common 
than not with the true unselfconscious believer.&nbsp; Gallio 
again, whose indifference to religious animosities has won him 
the cheapest immortality which, so far as I can remember, was 
ever yet won, was probably, if the truth were known, a person of 
the sincerest piety.&nbsp; It is the unconscious unbeliever who 
is the true infidel, however greatly he would be surprised to 
know the truth.&nbsp; Mr. Spurgeon was reported as having asked 
God to remove Lord Beaconsfield from office &ldquo;<i>as soon as 
possible</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There lurks a more profound distrust 
of God&rsquo;s power in these words than in almost any open 
denial of His existence.</p>
<p>In like manner, the most perfect humour and irony is generally
quite unconscious.&nbsp; Examples of both are frequently given by
men whom the world considers as deficient in humour; it is more 
probably true that these persons are unconscious of their own 
delightful power through the very mastery and perfection with 
which they hold it.&nbsp; There is a play, for instance, of 
genuine fun in some of the more serious scientific and 
theological journals which for some time past we have looked for 
in vain in &ldquo;---&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following extract, from a journal which I will not 
advertise, may serve as an example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lycurgus, when they had abandoned to his revenge him 
who had put out his eyes, took him home, and the punishment he 
inflicted upon him was sedulous instructions to 
virtue.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet this truly comic paper does not probably
know that it is comic, any more than the kleptomaniac knows that 
he steals, or than John Milton knew he was a humorist when he 
wrote a hymn upon the circumcision, and spent his honeymoon <!-- 
page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
77</span>in composing a treatise on divorce.&nbsp; No more again 
did Goethe know how exquisitely humorous he was when he wrote, in
his Wilhelm Meister, that a beautiful tear glistened in 
Theresa&rsquo;s right eye, and then went on to explain that it 
glistened in her right eye and not in her left, because she had 
had a wart on her left which had been removed&mdash;and 
successfully.&nbsp; Goethe probably wrote this without a chuckle;
he believed what a good many people who have never read Wilhelm 
Meister believe still, namely, that it was a work full of 
pathos&mdash;of fine and tender feeling; yet a less consummate 
humorist must have felt that there was scarcely a paragraph in it
from first to last the chief merit of which did not lie in its 
absurdity.</p>
<p>But enough has perhaps been said.&nbsp; As the fish in the 
sea, or the bird in the air, so unreasoningly and inarticulately 
safe must a man feel before he can be said to know.&nbsp; It is 
only those who are ignorant and uncultivated who can know 
anything at all in a proper sense of the words.&nbsp; Cultivation
will breed in any man a certainty of the uncertainty even of his 
most assured convictions.&nbsp; It is perhaps fortunate for our 
comfort that we can none of us be cultivated upon very many 
subjects, so that considerable scope for assurance will still 
remain to us; but however this may be, we certainly observe it as
a fact that those are the greatest men who are most uncertain in 
spite of certainty, and at the same time most certain in spite of
uncertainty, and who are thus best able to feel that there is 
nothing in such complete harmony with itself as a flat 
contradiction in terms.&nbsp; For nature hates that any principle
should breed, so to speak, hermaphroditically, but will give to 
each an help meet for it which shall cross it and be the undoing 
of it; as <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>in the case of descent with 
modification, of which the essence is that every offspring 
resembles its parents, and yet, at the same time, that no 
offspring resembles its parents.&nbsp; But for the slightly 
irritating stimulant of this perpetual crossing, we should pass 
our lives unconsciously as though in slumber.</p>
<p>Until we have got to understand that though black is not 
white, yet it may be whiter than white itself (and any painter 
will readily paint that which shall show obviously as black, yet 
it shall be whiter than that which shall show no less obviously 
as white), we may be good logicians, but we are still poor 
reasoners.&nbsp; Knowledge is in an inchoate state as long as it 
is capable of logical treatment; it must be transmuted into that 
sense or instinct which rises altogether above the sphere in 
which words can have being at all, otherwise it is not yet 
incarnate.&nbsp; For sense is to knowledge what conscience is to 
reasoning about light and wrong; the reasoning must be so rapid 
as to defy conscious reference to first principles, and even at 
times to be apparently subversive of them altogether, or the 
action will halt.&nbsp; It must become automatic before we are 
safe with it.&nbsp; While we are fumbling for the grounds of our 
conviction, our conviction is prone to fall, as Peter for lack of
faith sinking into the waves of Galilee; so that the very power 
to prove at all is an <i>&agrave; priori</i> argument against the
truth&mdash;or at any rate the practical importance to the vast 
majority of mankind&mdash;of all that is supported by 
demonstration.&nbsp; For the power to prove implies a sense of 
the need of proof, and things which the majority of mankind find 
practically important are in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred 
above proof.&nbsp; The need of proof becomes as obsolete in the 
case of assured knowledge, as the practice of fortifying <!-- 
page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>towns in the middle of an old and long-settled 
country.&nbsp; Who builds defences for that which is impregnable 
or little likely to be assailed?&nbsp; The answer is ready, that 
unless the defences had been built in former times it would be 
impossible to do without them now; but this does not touch the 
argument, which is not that demonstration is unwise but that as 
long as a demonstration is still felt necessary, and therefore 
kept ready to hand, the subject of such demonstration is not yet 
securely known.&nbsp; <i>Qui s&rsquo;excuse</i>, 
<i>s&rsquo;accuse</i>; and unless a matter can hold its own 
without the brag and self-assertion of continual demonstration, 
it is still more or less of a parvenu, which we shall not lose 
much by neglecting till it has less occasion to blow its own 
trumpet.&nbsp; The only alternative is that it is an error in 
process of detection, for if evidence concerning any opinion has 
long been deemed superfluous, and ever after this comes to be 
again felt necessary, we know that the opinion is doomed.</p>
<p>If there is any truth in the above, it follows that our 
conception of the words &ldquo;science&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; must undergo some modification.&nbsp; 
Not that we should speak slightingly of science, but that we 
should recognise more than we do, that there are two distinct 
classes of scientific people, corresponding not inaptly with the 
two main parties into which the political world is divided.&nbsp;
The one class is deeply versed in those sciences which have 
already become the common property of mankind; enjoying, 
enforcing, perpetuating, and engraining still more deeply into 
the mind of man acquisitions already approved by common 
experience, but somewhat careless about extension of empire, or 
at any rate disinclined, for the most part, to active effort on 
their own part for the sake of such extension&mdash;<!-- page 
80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
80</span>neither progressive, in fact, nor aggressive&mdash;but 
quiet, peaceable people, who wish to live and let live, as their 
fathers before them; while the other class is chiefly intent upon
pushing forward the boundaries of science, and is comparatively 
indifferent to what is known already save in so far as necessary 
for purposes of extension.&nbsp; These last are called pioneers 
of science, and to them alone is the title 
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; commonly accorded; but pioneers, 
important to an army as they are, are still not the army itself, 
which can get on better without the pioneers than the pioneers 
without the army.&nbsp; Surely the class which knows thoroughly 
well what it knows, and which adjudicates upon the value of the 
discoveries made by the pioneers&mdash;surely this class has as 
good a right or better to be called scientific than the pioneers 
themselves.</p>
<p>These two classes above described blend into one another with 
every shade of gradation.&nbsp; Some are admirably proficient in 
the well-known sciences&mdash;that is to say, they have good 
health, good looks, good temper, common sense, and energy, and 
they hold all these good things in such perfection as to be 
altogether without introspection&mdash;to be not under the law, 
but so entirely under grace that every one who sees them likes 
them.&nbsp; But such may, and perhaps more commonly will, have 
very little inclination to extend the boundaries of human 
knowledge; their aim is in another direction altogether.&nbsp; Of
the pioneers, on the other hand, some are agreeable people, well 
versed in the older sciences, though still more eminent as 
pioneers, while others, whose services in this last capacity have
been of inestimable value, are noticeably ignorant of the 
sciences which have already become current with the larger part 
of mankind&mdash;in other words, they are ugly, rude, and 
disagreeable <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>people, very progressive, it may be, 
but very aggressive to boot.</p>
<p>The main difference between these two classes lies in the fact
that the knowledge of the one, so far as it is new, is known 
consciously, while that of the other is unconscious, consisting 
of sense and instinct rather than of recognised knowledge.&nbsp; 
So long as a man has these, and of the same kind as the more 
powerful body of his fellow-countrymen, he is a man of science 
though he can hardly read or write.&nbsp; As my great namesake 
said so well, &ldquo;He knows what&rsquo;s what, and that&rsquo;s
as high as metaphysic wit can fly.&rdquo;&nbsp; As is usual in 
cases of great proficiency, these true and thorough knowers do 
not know that they are scientific, and can seldom give a reason 
for the faith that is in them.&nbsp; They believe themselves to 
be ignorant, uncultured men, nor can even the professors whom 
they sometimes outwit in their own professorial domain perceive 
that they have been outwitted by men of superior scientific 
attainments to their own.&nbsp; The following passage from Dr. 
Carpenter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mesmerism, Spiritualism,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
may serve as an illustration:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well known that persons who are conversant with 
the geological structure of a district are often able to indicate
with considerable certainty in what spot and at what depth water 
will be found; and men <i>of less scientific knowledge</i>, 
<i>but of considerable practical experience</i>&rdquo;&mdash;(so 
that in Dr. Carpenter&rsquo;s mind there seems to be some sort of
contrast or difference in kind between the knowledge which is 
derived from observation of facts and scientific 
knowledge)&mdash;&ldquo;frequently arrive at a true conclusion 
upon this point without being able to assign reasons for their 
opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly the same may be said in regard to the <!-- page
82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
82</span>mineral structure of a mining district; the course of a 
metallic vein being often correctly indicated by the shrewd guess
of an <i>observant</i> workman, when <i>the scientific 
reasoning</i> of the mining engineer altogether fails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Precisely.&nbsp; Here we have exactly the kind of thing we are
in search of: the man who has observed and observed till the 
facts are so thoroughly in his head that through familiarity he 
has lost sight both of them and of the processes whereby he 
deduced his conclusions from them&mdash;is apparently not 
considered scientific, though he knows how to solve the problem 
before him; the mining engineer, on the other hand, who reasons 
scientifically&mdash;that is to say, with a knowledge of his own 
knowledge&mdash;is found not to know, and to fail in discovering 
the mineral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an experience we are continually encountering in 
other walks of life,&rdquo; continues Dr. Carpenter, &ldquo;that 
particular persons are guided&mdash;some apparently by an 
original and others by <i>an acquired intuition</i>&mdash;to 
conclusions for which they can give no adequate reason, but which
subsequent events prove to have been correct.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
this, I take it, implies what I have been above insisting on, 
namely, that on becoming intense, knowledge seems also to become 
unaware of the grounds on which it rests, or that it has or 
requires grounds at all, or indeed even exists.&nbsp; The only 
issue between myself and Dr. Carpenter would appear to be that 
Dr. Carpenter, himself an acknowledged leader in the scientific 
world, restricts the term &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; to the people 
who know that they know, but are beaten by those who are not so 
conscious of their own knowledge; while I say that the term 
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; should be applied (only that they would 
not like it) to the nice sensible <!-- page 83--><a 
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>people who 
know what&rsquo;s what rather than to the professorial 
classes.</p>
<p>And this is easily understood when we remember that the 
pioneer cannot hope to acquire any of the new sciences in a 
single lifetime so perfectly as to become unaware of his own 
knowledge.&nbsp; As a general rule, we observe him to be still in
a state of active consciousness concerning whatever particular 
science he is extending, and as long as he is in this state he 
cannot know utterly.&nbsp; It is, as I have already so often 
insisted, those who do not know that they know so much who have 
the firmest grip of their knowledge: the best class, for example,
of our English youth, who live much in the open air, and, as Lord
Beaconsfield finely said, never read.&nbsp; These are the people 
who know best those things which are best worth 
knowing&mdash;that is to say, they are the most truly 
scientific.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the apparatus necessary for this kind of 
science is so costly as to be within the reach of few, involving,
as it does, an experience in the use of it for some preceding 
generations.&nbsp; Even those who are born with the means within 
their reach must take no less pains, and exercise no less 
self-control, before they can attain the perfect unconscious use 
of them, than would go to the making of a James Watt or a 
Stephenson; it is vain, therefore, to hope that this best kind of
science can ever be put within the reach of the many; 
nevertheless it may be safely said that all the other and more 
generally recognised kinds of science are valueless except in so 
far as they minister to this the highest kind.&nbsp; They have no
<i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> unless they tend to do away with
the necessity for work, and to diffuse good health, and that good
sense which is above self-consciousness.&nbsp; They are to be 
encouraged because <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>they have rendered the most fortunate
kind of modern European possible, and because they tend to make 
possible a still more fortunate kind than any now existing.&nbsp;
But the man who devotes himself to science cannot&mdash;with the 
rarest, if any, exceptions&mdash;belong to this most fortunate 
class himself.&nbsp; He occupies a lower place, both 
scientifically and morally, for it is not possible but that his 
drudgery should somewhat soil him both in mind and health of 
body, or, if this be denied, surely it must let him and hinder 
him in running the race for unconsciousness.&nbsp; We do not feel
that it increases the glory of a king or great nobleman that he 
should excel in what is commonly called science.&nbsp; Certainly 
he should not go further than Prince Rupert&rsquo;s drops.&nbsp; 
Nor should he excel in music, art, literature, or 
theology&mdash;all which things are more or less parts of 
science.&nbsp; He should be above them all, save in so far as he 
can without effort reap renown from the labours of others.&nbsp; 
It is a <i>l&aacute;che</i> in him that he should write music or 
books, or paint pictures at all; but if he must do so, his work 
should be at best contemptible.&nbsp; Much as we must condemn 
Marcus Aurelius, we condemn James I. even more severely.</p>
<p>It is a pity there should exist so general a confusion of 
thought upon this subject, for it may be asserted without fear of
contradiction that there is hardly any form of immorality now 
rife which produces more disastrous effects upon those who give 
themselves up to it, and upon society in general, than the 
so-called science of those who know that they know too well to be
able to know truly.&nbsp; With very clever people&mdash;the 
people who know that they know&mdash;it is much as with the 
members of the early Corinthian Church, to whom St. Paul wrote, 
that if they looked their numbers over, <!-- page 85--><a 
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>they would 
not find many wise, nor powerful, nor well-born people among 
them.&nbsp; Dog-fanciers tell us that performing dogs never carry
their tails; such dogs have eaten of the tree of knowledge, and 
are convinced of sin accordingly&mdash;they know that they know 
things, in respect of which, therefore, they are no longer under 
grace, but under the law, and they have yet so much grace left as
to be ashamed.&nbsp; So with the human clever dog; he may speak 
with the tongues of men and angels, but so long as he knows that 
he knows, his tail will droop.</p>
<p>More especially does this hold in the case of those who are 
born to wealth and of old family.&nbsp; We must all feel that a 
rich young nobleman with a taste for science and principles is 
rarely a pleasant object.&nbsp; We do not understand the rich 
young man in the Bible who wanted to inherit eternal life, 
unless, indeed, he merely wanted to know whether there was not 
some way by which he could avoid dying, and even so he is hardly 
worth considering.&nbsp; Principles are like logic, which never 
yet made a good reasoner of a bad one, but might still be 
occasionally useful if they did not invariably contradict each 
other whenever there is any temptation to appeal to them.&nbsp; 
They are like fire, good servants but bad masters.&nbsp; As many 
people or more have been wrecked on principle as from want of 
principle.&nbsp; They are, as their name implies, of an 
elementary character, suitable for beginners only, and he who has
so little mastered them as to have occasion to refer to them 
consciously, is out of place in the society of well-educated 
people.&nbsp; The truly scientific invariably hate him, and, for 
the most part, the more profoundly in proportion to the 
unconsciousness with which they do so.</p>

86</span>If the reader hesitates, let him go down into the 
streets and look in the shop-windows at the photographs of 
eminent men, whether literary, artistic, or scientific, and note 
the work which the consciousness of knowledge has wrought on nine
out of every ten of them; then let him go to the masterpieces of 
Greek and Italian art, the truest preachers of the truest gospel 
of grace; let him look at the Venus of Milo, the Discobolus, the 
St. George of Donatello.&nbsp; If it had pleased these people to 
wish to study, there was no lack of brains to do it with; but 
imagine &ldquo;what a deal of scorn&rdquo; would &ldquo;look 
beautiful in the contempt and anger&rdquo; of the Venus of 
Milo&rsquo;s lip if it were suggested to her that she should 
learn to read.&nbsp; Which, think you, knows most, the Theseus, 
or any modern professor taken at random?&nbsp; True, learning 
must have a great share in the advancement of beauty, inasmuch as
beauty is but knowledge perfected and incarnate&mdash;but with 
the pioneers it is <i>sic vos non vobis</i>; the grace is not for
them, but for those who come after.&nbsp; Science is like 
offences.&nbsp; It must needs come, but woe unto that man through
whom it comes; for there cannot be much beauty where there is 
consciousness of knowledge, and while knowledge is still new it 
must in the nature of things involve much consciousness.</p>
<p>It is not knowledge, then, that is incompatible with beauty; 
there cannot be too much knowledge, but it must have passed 
through many people who it is to be feared must be both ugly and 
disagreeable, before beauty or grace will have anything to say to
it; it must be so diffused throughout a man&rsquo;s whole being 
that he shall not be aware of it, or he will bear himself under 
it constrainedly as one under the law, and not as one under 
grace.</p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>And grace is best, for where grace is, love is not 
distant.&nbsp; Grace! the old Pagan ideal whose charm even 
unlovely Paul could not withstand, but, as the legend tells us, 
his soul fainted within him, his heart misgave him, and, standing
alone on the seashore at dusk, he &ldquo;troubled deaf heaven 
with his bootless cries,&rdquo; his thin voice pleading for grace
after the flesh.</p>
<p>The waves came in one after another, the sea-gulls cried 
together after their kind, the wind rustled among the dried canes
upon the sandbanks, and there came a voice from heaven saying, 
&ldquo;Let My grace be sufficient for thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereon,
failing of the thing itself, he stole the word and strove to 
crush its meaning to the measure of his own limitations.&nbsp; 
But the true grace, with her groves and high places, and troops 
of young men and maidens crowned with flowers, and singing of 
love and youth and wine&mdash;the true grace he drove out into 
the wilderness&mdash;high up, it may be, into Piora, and into 
such-like places.&nbsp; Happy they who harboured her in her ill 
report.</p>
<p>It is common to hear men wonder what new faith will be adopted
by mankind if disbelief in the Christian religion should become 
general.&nbsp; They seem to expect that some new theological or 
quasi-theological system will arise, which, <i>mutatis 
mutandis</i>, shall be Christianity over again.&nbsp; It is a 
frequent reproach against those who maintain that the 
supernatural element of Christianity is without foundation, that 
they bring forward no such system of their own.&nbsp; They pull 
down but cannot build.&nbsp; We sometimes hear even those who 
have come to the same conclusions as the destroyers say, that 
having nothing new to set up, they will not attack the old.&nbsp;
But how can people set up a new superstition, knowing it to be a 
superstition?&nbsp; Without faith in <!-- page 88--><a 
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>their own 
platform, a faith as intense as that manifested by the early 
Christians, how can they preach?&nbsp; A new superstition will 
come, but it is in the very essence of things that its apostles 
should have no suspicion of its real nature; that they should no 
more recognise the common element between the new and the old 
than the early Christians recognised it between their faith and 
Paganism.&nbsp; If they did, they would be paralysed.&nbsp; 
Others say that the new fabric may be seen rising on every side, 
and that the coming religion is science.&nbsp; Certainly its 
apostles preach it without misgiving, but it is not on that 
account less possible that it may prove only to be the coming 
superstition&mdash;like Christianity, true to its true votaries, 
and, like Christianity, false to those who follow it 
introspectively.</p>
<p>It may well be we shall find we have escaped from one set of 
taskmasters to fall into the hands of others far more 
ruthless.&nbsp; The tyranny of the Church is light in comparison 
with that which future generations may have to undergo at the 
hands of the doctrinaires.&nbsp; The Church did uphold a grace of
some sort as the <i>summum bonum</i>, in comparison with which 
all so-called earthly knowledge&mdash;knowledge, that is to say, 
which had not passed through so many people as to have become 
living and incarnate&mdash;was unimportant.&nbsp; Do what we may,
we are still drawn to the unspoken teaching of her less 
introspective ages with a force which no falsehood could 
command.&nbsp; Her buildings, her music, her architecture, touch 
us as none other on the whole can do; when she speaks there are 
many of us who think that she denies the deeper truths of her own
profounder mind, and unfortunately her tendency is now towards 
more rather than less introspection.&nbsp; The more she gives way
to this&mdash;the more she becomes <!-- page 89--><a 
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>conscious of 
knowing&mdash;the less she will know.&nbsp; But still her ideal 
is in grace.</p>
<p>The so-called man of science, on the other hand, seems now 
generally inclined to make light of all knowledge, save of the 
pioneer character.&nbsp; His ideal is in self-conscious 
knowledge.&nbsp; Let us have no more Lo, here, with the 
professor; he very rarely knows what he says he knows; no sooner 
has he misled the world for a sufficient time with a great 
flourish of trumpets than he is toppled over by one more 
plausible than himself.&nbsp; He is but medicine-man, augur, 
priest, in its latest development; useful it may be, but 
requiring to be well watched by those who value freedom.&nbsp; 
Wait till he has become more powerful, and note the vagaries 
which his conceit of knowledge will indulge in.&nbsp; The Church 
did not persecute while she was still weak.&nbsp; Of course every
system has had, and will have, its heroes, but, as we all very 
well know, the heroism of the hero is but remotely due to system;
it is due not to arguments, nor reasoning, nor to any consciously
recognised perceptions, but to those deeper sciences which lie 
far beyond the reach of self-analysis, and for the study of which
there is but one schooling&mdash;to have had good forefathers for
many generations.</p>
<p>Above all things let no unwary reader do me the injustice of 
believing in <i>me</i>.&nbsp; In that I write at all I am among 
the damned.&nbsp; If he must believe in anything, let him believe
in the music of Handel, the painting of Giovanni Bellini, and in 
the thirteenth chapter of St. Paul&rsquo;s First Epistle to the 
Corinthians.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; Whenever we find people knowing that they
know this or that, we have the same story over and over 
again.&nbsp; They do not yet know it perfectly.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
90</span>We come, therefore, to the conclusion that our knowledge
and reasonings thereupon, only become perfect, assured, 
unhesitating, when they have become automatic, and are thus 
exercised without further conscious effort of the mind, much in 
the same way as we cannot walk nor read nor write perfectly till 
we can do so automatically.</p>
<h3><!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
91</span>APPLICATION OF FOREGOING CHAPTERS TO CERTAIN HABITS 
ACQUIRED AFTER BIRTH WHICH ARE COMMONLY CONSIDERED 
INSTINCTIVE.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">chapter iii. of life and 
habit</span>.)</h3>
<p>What is true of knowing is also true of willing.&nbsp; The 
more intensely we will, the less is our will deliberate and 
capable of being recognised as will at all.&nbsp; So that it is 
common to hear men declare under certain circumstances that they 
had no will, but were forced into their own action under stress 
of passion or temptation.&nbsp; But in the more ordinary actions 
of life, we observe, as in walking or breathing, that we do not 
will anything utterly and without remnant of hesitation, till we 
have lost sight of the fact that we are exercising our will.</p>
<p>The question, therefore, is forced upon us, how far this 
principle extends, and whether there may not be unheeded examples
of its operation which, if we consider them, will land us in 
rather unexpected conclusions.&nbsp; If it be granted that 
consciousness of knowledge and of volition vanishes when the 
knowledge and the volition have become intense and perfect, may 
it not be possible that many actions which we do without knowing 
how we do them, and without any conscious exercise of the 
will&mdash;actions which we certainly could <!-- page 92--><a 
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>not do if we 
tried to do them, nor refrain from doing if for any reason we 
wished to do so&mdash;are done so easily and so unconsciously 
owing to excess of knowledge or experience rather than 
deficiency, we having done them too often, knowing how to do them
too well, and having too little hesitation as to the method of 
procedure, to be capable of following our own action, without the
derangement of such action altogether; or, in other cases, 
because we have so long settled the question that we have stowed 
away the whole apparatus with which we work in corners of our 
system which we cannot now conveniently reach?</p>
<p>It may be interesting to see whether we can find any class or 
classes of actions which link actions which for some time after 
birth we could not do at all, and in which our proficiency has 
reached the stage of unconscious performance obviously through 
repeated effort and failure, and through this only, with actions 
which we could do as soon as we were born, and concerning which 
it would at first sight appear absurd to say that they can have 
been acquired by any process in the least analogous to what we 
commonly call experience, inasmuch as the creature itself which 
does them has only just begun to exist, and cannot, therefore, in
the very nature of things, have had experience.</p>
<p>Can we see that actions, for the acquisition of which 
experience is such an obvious necessity, that whenever we see the
acquisition we assume the experience, gradate away imperceptibly 
into actions which seem, according to all reasonable analogy, to 
necessitate experience&mdash;of which, however, the time and 
place are so obscure, that they are not now commonly supposed to 
have any connection with <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> experience at 
all.</p>
<p>Eating and drinking appear to be such actions.&nbsp; The <!-- 
page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
93</span>new-born child cannot eat, and cannot drink, but he can 
swallow as soon as he is born; and swallowing appears (as we may 
remark in passing) to have been an earlier faculty of animal life
than that of eating with teeth.&nbsp; The ease and 
unconsciousness with which we eat and drink is clearly 
attributable to practice; but a very little practice seems to go 
a long way&mdash;a suspiciously small amount of practice&mdash;as
though somewhere or at some other time there must have been more 
practice than we can account for.&nbsp; We can very readily stop 
eating or drinking, and can follow our own action without 
difficulty in either process; but as regards swallowing, which is
the earlier habit, we have less power of self-analysis and 
control: when we have once committed ourselves beyond a certain 
point to swallowing, we must finish doing so,&mdash;that is to 
say, our control over the operation ceases.&nbsp; Also, a still 
smaller experience seems necessary for the acquisition of the 
power to swallow than appeared necessary in the case of eating; 
and if we get into a difficulty we choke, and are more at a loss 
how to become introspective than we are about eating and 
drinking.</p>
<p>Why should a baby be able to swallow&mdash;which one would 
have said was the more complicated process of the two&mdash;with 
so much less practice than it takes him to learn to eat?&nbsp; 
How comes it that he exhibits in the case of the more difficult 
operation all the phenomena which ordinarily accompany a more 
complete mastery and longer practice?&nbsp; Analogy points in the
direction of thinking that the necessary experience cannot have 
been wanting, and that, too, not in such a quibbling sort as when
people talk about inherited habit or the experience of the race, 
which, without explanation, is to plain-speaking persons very 
much the <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>same, in regard to the individual, as
no experience at all, but <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> in the 
child&rsquo;s own person.</p>
<p>Breathing, again, is an action acquired after birth, generally
with some little hesitation and difficulty, but still acquired in
a time seldom longer, as I am informed, than ten minutes or a 
quarter of an hour.&nbsp; For an art which has to be acquired at 
all, there seems here, as in the case of eating, to be a 
disproportion between, on the one hand, the intricacy of the 
process performed, and on the other, the shortness of the time 
taken to acquire the practice, and the ease and unconsciousness 
with which its exercise is continued from the moment of 
acquisition.</p>
<p>We observe that in later life much less difficult and 
intricate operations than breathing require much longer practice 
before they can be mastered to the extent of unconscious 
performance.&nbsp; We observe also that the phenomena attendant 
on the learning by an infant to breathe are extremely like those 
attendant upon the repetition of some performance by one who has 
done it very often before, but who requires just a little 
prompting to set him off, on getting which, the whole familiar 
routine presents itself before him, and he repeats his task by 
rote.&nbsp; Surely then we are justified in suspecting that there
must have been more <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> personal recollection 
and experience, with more effort and failure on the part of the 
infant itself, than meet the eye.</p>
<p>It should be noticed, also that our control over breathing is 
very limited.&nbsp; We can hold our breath a little, or breathe a
little faster for a short time, but we cannot do this for long, 
and after having gone without air for a certain time we must 
breathe.</p>
<p>Seeing and hearing require some practice before their free use
is mastered, but not very much.&nbsp; They are so <!-- page 
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>far 
within our control that we can see more by looking harder, and 
hear more by listening attentively&mdash;but they are beyond our 
control in so far as that we must see and hear the greater part 
of what presents itself to us as near, and at the same time 
unfamiliar, unless we turn away or shut our eyes, or stop our 
ears by a mechanical process; and when we do this it is a sign 
that we have already involuntarily seen or heard more than we 
wished.&nbsp; The familiar, whether sight or sound, very commonly
escapes us.</p>
<p>Take again the processes of digestion, the action of the 
heart, and the oxygenisation of the blood&mdash;processes of 
extreme intricacy, done almost entirely unconsciously, and quite 
beyond the control of our volition.</p>
<p>Is it possible that our unconsciousness concerning our own 
performance of all these processes arises from 
over-experience?</p>
<p>Is there anything in digestion or the oxygenisation of the 
blood different in kind to the rapid unconscious action of a man 
playing a difficult piece of music on the piano?&nbsp; There may 
be in degree, but as a man who sits down to play what he well 
knows, plays on when once started, almost, as we say, 
mechanically, so, having eaten his dinner, he digests it as a 
matter of course, unless it has been in some way unfamiliar to 
him or he to it, owing to some derangement or occurrence with 
which he is unfamiliar, and under which therefore he is at a loss
how to comport himself, as a player would be at a loss how to 
play with gloves on, or with gout in his fingers, or if set to 
play music upside down.</p>
<p>Can we show that all the acquired actions of childhood and 
after-life, which we now do unconsciously, or without conscious 
exercise of the will, are familiar <!-- page 96--><a 
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
96</span>acts&mdash;acts which we have already done a very great 
number of times?</p>
<p>Can we also show that there are no acquired actions which we 
can perform in this automatic manner which were not at one time 
difficult, requiring attention, and liable to repeated failure, 
our volition failing to command obedience from the members which 
should carry its purposes into execution?</p>
<p>If so, analogy will point in the direction of thinking that 
other acts which we do even more unconsciously may only escape 
our power of self-examination and control because they are even 
more familiar&mdash;because we have done them oftener; and we may
imagine that if there were a microscope which could show us the 
minutest atoms of consciousness and volition, we should find that
even the apparently most automatic actions were yet done in due 
course, upon a balance of considerations, and under the 
deliberate exercise of the will.</p>
<p>We should also incline to think that even such an action as 
the oxygenisation of its blood by an infant of ten minutes&rsquo;
old, can only be done so well and so unconsciously, after 
repeated failures on the part of the infant itself.</p>
<p>True, as has been already implied, we do not immediately see 
when the baby could have made the necessary mistakes and acquired
that infinite practice without which it could never go through 
such complex processes satisfactorily; we have therefore invented
the word &ldquo;heredity,&rdquo; and consider it as accounting 
for the phenomena; but a little reflection will show that though 
this word may be a very good way of stating the difficulty, it 
does nothing whatever towards removing it. <a 
name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96" 
class="citation">[96]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
97</span>Why should heredity enable a creature to dispense with 
the experience which we see to be necessary in all other cases 
before difficult operations can be performed successfully?</p>
<p>What is this talk that is made about the experience <i>of the 
race</i>, as though the experience of one man could profit 
another who knows nothing about him?&nbsp; If a man eats his 
dinner, it nourishes <i>him</i> and not his neighbour; if he 
learns a difficult art, it is <i>he</i> that can do it and not 
his neighbour.&nbsp; Yet, practically, we see that the vicarious 
experience, which seems so contrary to our common observation, 
does nevertheless appear to hold good in the case of creatures 
and their descendants.&nbsp; Is there, then, any way of bringing 
these apparently conflicting phenomena under the operation of one
law?&nbsp; Is there any way of showing that this experience of 
the race, of which so much is said without the least attempt to 
show in what way it may or does become the experience of the 
individual, is in sober seriousness the experience of one single 
being only, repeating in a great many different ways certain 
performances with which it has become exceedingly familiar?</p>
<p>It comes to this&mdash;that we must either suppose the 
conditions of experience to differ during the earlier stages of 
life from those which we observe them to become during the heyday
of any existence&mdash;and this would appear very gratuitous, 
tolerable only as a suggestion because the beginnings of life are
so obscure, that in such twilight we may do pretty much whatever 
we please without fear of being found out&mdash;or that we must 
suppose continuity of life and sameness between living beings, 
whether plants or animals, and their descendants, to be far 
closer than we have hitherto believed; so that the experience of 
one person is <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>not enjoyed by his successor, so much
as that the successor is <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> an elongation of 
the life of his progenitors, imbued with their memories, 
profiting by their experiences&mdash;which are, in fact, his own 
until he leaves their bodies&mdash;and only unconscious of the 
extent of these memories and experiences owing to their vastness 
and already infinite repetition.</p>
<p>Certainly it presents itself to us as a singular 
coincidence&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That we are <i>most conscious of</i>, <i>and have 
most control over</i>, such habits as speech, the upright 
position, the arts and sciences&mdash;which are acquisitions 
peculiar to the human race, always acquired after birth, and not 
common to ourselves and any ancestor who had not become entirely 
human.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That we are <i>less conscious of</i>, <i>and have 
less control over</i>, the use of teeth, swallowing, breathing, 
seeing and hearing&mdash;which were acquisitions of our prehuman 
ancestry, and for which we had provided ourselves with all the 
necessary apparatus before we saw light, but which are still, 
geologically speaking, recent, or comparatively recent.</p>
<p>ill.&nbsp; That we are <i>most unconscious of</i>, <i>and have
least control over</i>, our digestion, which we have in common 
even with our invertebrate ancestry, and which is a habit of 
extreme antiquity.</p>
<p>There is something too like method in this for it to be taken 
as the result of mere chance&mdash;chance again being but another
illustration of Nature&rsquo;s love of a contradiction in terms; 
for everything is chance, and nothing is chance.&nbsp; And you 
may take it that all is chance or nothing chance, according as 
you please, but you must not have half chance and half not 
chance&mdash;which, however, in practice is just what you 
<i>must</i> have.</p>
<p><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
99</span>Does it not seem as though the older and more confirmed 
the habit, the more unquestioning the act of volition, till, in 
the case of the oldest habits, the practice of succeeding 
existences has so formulated the procedure, that, on being once 
committed to such and such a line beyond a certain point, the 
subsequent course is so clear as to be open to no further doubt, 
and admit of no alternative, till the very power of questioning 
is gone, and even the consciousness of volition?&nbsp; And this 
too upon matters which, in earlier stages of a man&rsquo;s 
existence, admitted of passionate argument and anxious 
deliberation whether to resolve them thus or thus, with heroic 
hazard and experiment, which on the losing side proved to be 
vice, and on the winning virtue.&nbsp; For there was passionate 
argument once what shape a man&rsquo;s teeth should be, nor can 
the colour of his hair be considered as even yet settled, or 
likely to be settled for a very long time.</p>
<p>It is one against legion when a creature tries to differ from 
his own past selves.&nbsp; He must yield or die if he wants to 
differ widely, so as to lack natural instincts, such as hunger or
thirst, or not to gratify them.&nbsp; It is more righteous in a 
man that he should &ldquo;eat strange food,&rdquo; and that his 
cheek should &ldquo;so much as lank not,&rdquo; than that he 
should starve if the strange food be at his command.&nbsp; His 
past selves are living in unruly hordes within him at this moment
and overmastering him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do this, this, this, which we
too have done, and found our profit in it,&rdquo; cry the souls 
of his forefathers within him.&nbsp; Faint are the far ones, 
coming and going as the sound of bells wafted on to a high 
mountain; loud and clear are the near ones, urgent as an alarm of
fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Withhold,&rdquo; cry some.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on 
boldly,&rdquo; cry others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me, me, me, revert <!-- 
page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
100</span>hitherward, my descendant,&rdquo; shouts one as it were
from some high vantage-ground over the heads of the clamorous 
multitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, but me, me, me,&rdquo; echoes 
another; and our former selves fight within us and wrangle for 
our possession.&nbsp; Have we not here what is commonly called an
<i>internal tumult</i>, when dead pleasures and pains tug within 
us hither and thither?&nbsp; Then may the battle be decided by 
what people are pleased to call our own experience.&nbsp; Our own
indeed!&nbsp; What is our own save by mere courtesy of 
speech?&nbsp; A matter of fashion.&nbsp; Sanction sanctifieth and
fashion fashioneth.&nbsp; And so with death&mdash;the most 
inexorable of all conventions.</p>
<p>However this may be, we may assume it as an axiom with regard 
to actions acquired after birth, that we never do them 
automatically save as the result of long practice, and after 
having thus acquired perfect mastery over the action in 
question.</p>
<p>But given the practice or experience, and the intricacy of the
process to be performed appears to matter very little.&nbsp; 
There is hardly anything conceivable as being done by man, which 
a certain amount of familiarity will not enable him to do, 
unintrospectively, and without conscious effort.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
most complex and difficult movements,&rdquo; writes Mr. Darwin, 
&ldquo;can in time be performed without the least effort or 
consciousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the main business of life is done
thus unconsciously or semi-unconsciously.&nbsp; For what is the 
main business of life?&nbsp; We work that we may eat and digest, 
rather than eat and digest that we may work; this, at any rate, 
is the normal state of things; the more important business then 
is that which is carried on unconsciously.&nbsp; So again, the 
action of the brain, which goes on prior to our realising the 
idea in which it results, is not perceived <!-- page 101--><a 
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>by the 
individual.&nbsp; So also all the deeper springs of action and 
conviction.&nbsp; The residuum with which we fret and worry 
ourselves is a mere matter of detail, as the higgling and 
haggling of the market, which is not over the bulk of the price, 
but over the last halfpenny.</p>
<p>Shall we say, then, that a baby of a day old sucks (which 
involves the whole principle of the pump, and hence a profound 
practical knowledge of the laws of pneumatics and hydrostatics), 
digests, oxygenises its blood (millions of years before Sir 
Humphry Davy discovered oxygen), sees and hears&mdash;all most 
difficult and complicated operations, involving an unconscious 
knowledge of the facts concerning optics and acoustics, compared 
with which the conscious discoveries of Newton sink into utter 
insignificance?&nbsp; Shall we say that a baby can do all these 
things at once, doing them so well and so regularly, without 
being even able to direct its attention to them, and without 
mistake, and at the same time not know how to do them, and never 
have done them before?</p>
<p>Such an assertion would be a contradiction to the whole 
experience of mankind.&nbsp; Surely the <i>onus probandi</i> must
rest with him who makes it.</p>
<p>A man may make a lucky hit now and again by what is called a 
fluke, but even this must be only a little in advance of his 
other performances of the same kind.&nbsp; He may multiply seven 
by eight by a fluke after a little study of the multiplication 
table, but he will not be able to extract the cube root of 4913 
by a fluke, without long training in arithmetic, any more than an
agricultural labourer would be able to operate successfully for 
cataract.&nbsp; If, then, a grown man cannot perform so simple an
operation as that, we will say, for <!-- page 102--><a 
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>cataract, 
unless he have been long trained in other similar operations, and
until he has done what comes to the same thing many times over, 
with what show of reason can we maintain that one who is so far 
less capable than a grown man, can perform such vastly more 
difficult operations, without knowing how to do them, and without
ever having done them before?&nbsp; There is no sign of 
&ldquo;fluke&rdquo; about the circulation of a baby&rsquo;s 
blood.&nbsp; There may perhaps be some little hesitation about 
its earliest breathing, but this, as a general rule, soon passes 
over, both breathing and circulation, within an hour after birth,
being as regular and easy as at any time during life.&nbsp; Is it
reasonable, then, to say that the baby does these things without 
knowing how to do them, and without ever having done them before,
and continues to do them by a series of lifelong flukes?</p>
<p>It would be well if those who feel inclined to hazard such an 
assertion would find some other instances of intricate processes 
gone through by people who know nothing about them, and who never
had any practice therein.&nbsp; What <i>is</i> to know how to do 
a thing?&nbsp; Surely to do it.&nbsp; What is proof that we know 
how to do a thing?&nbsp; Surely the fact that we can do it.&nbsp;
A man shows that he knows how to throw the boomerang by throwing 
the boomerang.&nbsp; No amount of talking or writing can get over
this; <i>ipso facto</i>, that a baby breathes and makes its blood
circulate, it knows how to do so; and the fact that it does not 
know its own knowledge is only proof of the perfection of that 
knowledge, and of the vast number of past occasions on which it 
must have been exercised already.&nbsp; As has been said already,
it is less obvious when the baby could have gained its 
experience, so as to be able so readily to remember exactly what 
to do; <i>but it is more </i><!-- page 103--><a 
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span><i>easy to 
suppose that the necessary occasions cannot have been 
wanting</i>, <i>than that the power which we observe</i>, 
<i>should have been obtained without practice and memory</i>.</p>
<p>If we saw any self-consciousness on the baby&rsquo;s part 
about its breathing or circulation, we might suspect that it had 
had less experience, or had profited less by its experience, than
its neighbours&mdash;exactly in the same manner as we suspect a 
deficiency of any quality which we see a man inclined to 
parade.&nbsp; We all become introspective when we find that we do
not know our business, and whenever we are introspective we may 
generally suspect that we are on the verge of 
unproficiency.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the case of sickly 
children we observe that they sometimes do become conscious of 
their breathing and circulation, just as in later life we become 
conscious that we have a liver or a digestion.&nbsp; In that case
there is always something wrong.&nbsp; The baby that becomes 
aware of its breathing does not know how to breathe and will 
suffer for his ignorance and incapacity, exactly in the same way 
as he will suffer in later life for ignorance and incapacity in 
any other respect in which his peers are commonly knowing and 
capable.&nbsp; In the case of inability to breathe, the 
punishment is corporal, breathing being a matter of fashion, so 
old and long settled that nature can admit of no departure from 
the established custom, and the procedure in case of failure is 
as much formulated as the fashion itself.&nbsp; In the case of 
the circulation, the whole performance has become one so utterly 
of rote, that the mere discovery that we could do it at all was 
considered one of the highest flights of human genius.</p>
<p>It has been said a day will come when the Polar ice shall have
accumulated, till it forms vast continents many thousands of feet
above the level of the sea, all of <!-- page 104--><a 
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>solid 
ice.&nbsp; The weight of this mass will, it is believed, cause 
the world to topple over on its axis, so that the earth will be 
upset as an ant-heap overturned by a ploughshare.&nbsp; In that 
day the icebergs will come crunching against our proudest cities,
razing them from off the face of the earth as though they were 
made of rotten blotting-paper.&nbsp; There is no respect now of 
Handel nor of Shakespeare; the works of Rembrandt and Bellini 
fossilise at the bottom of the sea.&nbsp; Grace, beauty, and wit,
all that is precious in music, literature, and art&mdash;all 
gone.&nbsp; In the morning there was Europe.&nbsp; In the evening
there are no more populous cities nor busy hum of men, but a sea 
of jagged ice, a lurid sunset, and the doom of many ages.&nbsp; 
Then shall a scared remnant escape in places, and settle upon the
changed continent when the waters have subsided&mdash;a simple 
people, busy hunting shellfish on the drying ocean beds, and with
little time for introspection; yet they can read and write and 
sum, for by that time these accomplishments will have become 
universal, and will be acquired as easily as we now learn to 
talk; but they do so as a matter of course, and without 
self-consciousness.&nbsp; Also they make the simpler kinds of 
machinery too easily to be able to follow their own 
operations&mdash;the manner of their own apprenticeship being to 
them as a buried city.&nbsp; May we not imagine that, after the 
lapse of another ten thousand years or so, some one of them may 
again become cursed with lust of introspection, and a second 
Harvey may astonish the world by discovering that it can read and
write, and that steam-engines do not grow, but are made?&nbsp; It
may be safely prophesied that he will die a martyr, and be 
honoured in the fourth generation.</p>
<h3><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>PERSONAL IDENTITY.&nbsp; (<span 
class="smcap">chapter v. of life and habit</span>.)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Strange difficulties have been raised by some,&rdquo; 
says Bishop Butler, &ldquo;concerning personal identity, or the 
sameness of living agents as implied in the notion of our 
existing now and hereafter, or indeed in any two consecutive 
moments.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in truth it is not easy to see the 
strangeness of the difficulty, if the words either 
&ldquo;personal&rdquo; or &ldquo;identity&rdquo; are used in any 
strictness.</p>
<p>Personality is one of those ideas with which we are so 
familiar that we have lost sight of the foundations upon which it
rests.&nbsp; We regard our personality as a simple definite 
whole; as a plain, palpable, individual thing, which can be seen 
going about the streets or sitting indoors at home; as something 
which lasts us our lifetime, and about the confines of which no 
doubt can exist in the minds of reasonable people.&nbsp; But in 
truth this &ldquo;we,&rdquo; which looks so simple and definite, 
is a nebulous and indefinable aggregation of many component parts
which war not a little among themselves, our perception of our 
existence at all being perhaps due to this very clash of warfare,
as our sense of sound and light is due to the jarring of 
vibrations.&nbsp; Moreover, as the component parts of our 
identity change from moment to moment, our personality becomes a 
thing <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>dependent upon time present, which 
has no logical existence, but lives only upon the sufferance of 
times past and future, slipping out of our hands into the domain 
of one or other of these two claimants the moment we try to 
apprehend it.&nbsp; And not only is our personality as fleeting 
as the present moment, but the parts which compose it blend some 
of them so imperceptibly into, and are so inextricably linked on 
to, outside things which clearly form no part of our personality,
that when we try to bring ourselves to book and determine wherein
we consist, or to draw a line as to where we begin or end, we 
find ourselves baffled.&nbsp; There is nothing but fusion and 
confusion.</p>
<p>Putting theology on one side, and dealing only with the common
sense of mankind, our body is certainly part of our 
personality.&nbsp; With the destruction of our bodies, our 
personality, as far as we can follow it, comes to a full stop; 
and with every modification of them it is correspondingly 
modified.&nbsp; But what are the limits of our bodies?&nbsp; They
are composed of parts, some of them so unessential as to be 
hardly included in personality at all, and to be separable from 
ourselves without perceptible effect, as hair, nails, and daily 
waste of tissue.&nbsp; Again, other parts are very important, as 
our hands, feet, arms, legs, &amp;c., but still are no essential 
parts of our &ldquo;self&rdquo; or &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; which 
continues to exist, though in a modified condition, in spite of 
their amputation.&nbsp; Other parts, as the brain, heart, and 
blood, are so essential that they cannot be dispensed with, yet 
it is impossible to say that personality consists in any one of 
them.</p>
<p>Each one of these component members of our personality is 
continually dying and being born again, supported in this process
by the food we eat, the water <!-- page 107--><a 
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>we drink, 
and the air we breathe; which three things link us on, and fetter
us down, to the organic and inorganic world about us.&nbsp; For 
our meat and drink, though no part of our personality before we 
eat and drink, cannot, after we have done so, be separated 
entirely from us without the destruction of our personality 
altogether, so far as we can follow it; and who shall say at what
precise moment our food has or has not become part of 
ourselves?&nbsp; A famished man eats food; after a short time his
whole personality is so palpably affected that we know the food 
to have entered into him and taken, as it were, possession of 
him; but who can say at what precise moment it did so?&nbsp; Thus
we find that we melt away into outside things and are rooted into
them as plants into the soil in which they grow, nor can any man 
say he consists absolutely in this or that, nor define himself so
certainly as to include neither more nor less than himself; many 
undoubted parts of his personality being more separable from it, 
and changing it less when so separated, both to his own senses 
and those of other people, than other parts which are strictly 
speaking no parts at all.</p>
<p>A man&rsquo;s clothes, for example, as they lie on a chair at 
night are no part of him, but when he wears them they would 
appear to be so, as being a kind of food which warms him and 
hatches him, and the loss of which may kill him of cold.&nbsp; If
this be denied, and a man&rsquo;s clothes be considered as no 
part of his self, nevertheless they, with his money, and it may 
perhaps be added his religious opinions, stamp a man&rsquo;s 
individuality as strongly as any natural feature can stamp 
it.&nbsp; Change in style of dress, gain or loss of money, make a
man feel and appear more changed than having his chin shaved or 
his nails cut.&nbsp; In fact, as soon as <!-- page 108--><a 
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>we leave 
common parlance on one side, and try for a scientific definition 
of personality, we find that there is none possible, any more 
than there can be a demonstration of the fact that we exist at 
all&mdash;a demonstration for which, as for that of a personal 
God, many have hunted but which none have found.&nbsp; The only 
solid foundation is, as in the case of the earth&rsquo;s crust, 
pretty near the surface of things; the deeper we try to go, the 
damper, darker, and altogether more uncongenial we find it.&nbsp;
There is no quagmire of superstition into which we may not be 
easily lured if we once cut ourselves adrift from those 
superficial aspects of things, in which alone our nature permits 
us to be comforted.</p>
<p>Common parlance, however, settles the difficulty readily 
enough (as indeed it settles most others if they show signs of 
awkwardness) by the simple process of ignoring it: we decline, 
and very properly, to go into the question of where personality 
begins and ends, but assume it to be known by every one, and 
throw the onus of not knowing it upon the over-curious, who had 
better think as their neighbours do, right or wrong, or there is 
no knowing into what villany they may not presently fall.</p>
<p>Assuming, then, that every one knows what is meant by the word
&ldquo;person&rdquo; (and such superstitious bases as this are 
the foundations upon which all action, whether of man, beast, or 
plant, is constructed and rendered possible; for even the corn in
the fields grows upon a superstitious basis as to its own 
existence, and only turns the earth and moisture into wheat 
through the conceit of its own ability to do so, without which 
faith it were powerless; and the lichen only grows upon the 
granite rock by first saying to itself, &ldquo;I think I can do 
it;&rdquo; so that it would not be able <!-- page 109--><a 
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>to grow 
unless it thought it could grow, and would not think it could 
grow unless it found itself able to grow, and thus spends its 
life arguing most virtuously in a most vicious 
circle&mdash;basing action upon hypothesis, which hypothesis is 
in turn based upon action)&mdash;assuming that we know what is 
meant by the word &ldquo;person,&rdquo; we say that we are one 
and the same person from birth till death, so that whatever is 
done by or happens to any one between birth and death, is said to
happen to or be done by one individual.&nbsp; This in practice is
found sufficient for the law courts and the purposes of daily 
life, which, being full of hurry and the pressure of business, 
can only tolerate compromise, or conventional rendering of 
intricate phenomena.&nbsp; When facts of extreme complexity have 
to be daily and hourly dealt with by people whose time is money, 
they must be simplified, and treated much as a painter treats 
them, drawing them in squarely, seizing the more important 
features, and neglecting all that does not assert itself as too 
essential to be passed over&mdash;hence the slang and cant words 
of every profession, and indeed all language; for language at 
best is but a kind of &ldquo;patter,&rdquo; the only way, it is 
true, in many cases, of expressing our ideas to one another, but 
still a very bad way, and not for one moment comparable to the 
unspoken speech which we may sometimes have recourse to.&nbsp; 
The metaphors and <i>fa&ccedil;ons de parler</i> to which even in
the plainest speech we are perpetually recurring (as, for 
example, in this last two lines, &ldquo;plain,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;perpetually,&rdquo; and &ldquo;recurring,&rdquo; are all 
words based on metaphor, and hence more or less liable to 
mislead) often deceive us, as though there were nothing more than
what we see and say, and as though words, instead of being, as 
they are, the creatures of our convenience, had some claim to be 
<!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
110</span>the actual ideas themselves concerning which we are 
conversing.</p>
<p>This is so well expressed in a letter I have recently received
from a friend, now in New Zealand, and certainly not intended by 
him for publication, that I shall venture to quote the passage, 
but should say that I do so without his knowledge or permission 
which I should not be able to receive before this book must be 
completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words, words, words,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;are the 
stumbling-blocks in the way of truth.&nbsp; Until you think of 
things as they are, and not of the words that misrepresent them, 
you cannot think rightly.&nbsp; Words produce the appearance of 
hard and fast lines where there are none.&nbsp; Words divide; 
thus we call this a man, that an ape, that a monkey, while they 
are all only differentiations of the same thing.&nbsp; To think 
of a thing they must be got rid of: they are the clothes that 
thoughts wear&mdash;only the clothes.&nbsp; I say this over and 
over again, for there is nothing of more importance.&nbsp; Other 
men&rsquo;s words will stop you at the beginning of an 
investigation.&nbsp; A man may play with words all his life, 
arranging them and rearranging them like dominoes.&nbsp; If I 
could <i>think</i> to you without words you would understand me 
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If such remarks as the above hold good at all, they do so with
the words &ldquo;personal identity.&rdquo;&nbsp; The least 
reflection will show that personal identity in any sort of 
strictness is an impossibility.&nbsp; The expression is one of 
the many ways in which we are obliged to scamp our thoughts 
through pressure of other business which pays us better.&nbsp; 
For surely all reasonable people will feel that an infant an hour
before birth, when in the eye of the law he has no existence, and
could not be <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>called a peer for another sixty 
minutes, though his father were a peer, and already 
dead,&mdash;surely such an embryo is more personally identical 
with the baby into which he develops within an hour&rsquo;s time 
than the born baby is so with itself (if the expression may be 
pardoned), one, twenty, or it may be eighty years after 
birth.&nbsp; There is more sameness of matter; there are fewer 
differences of any kind perceptible by a third person; there is 
more sense of continuity on the part of the person himself, and 
far more of all that goes to make up our sense of sameness of 
personality between an embryo an hour before birth and the child 
on being born, than there is between the child just born and the 
man of twenty.&nbsp; Yet there is no hesitation about admitting 
sameness of personality between these two last.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if that hazy contradiction in terms, 
&ldquo;personal identity,&rdquo; be once allowed to retreat 
behind the threshold of the womb, it has eluded us once for 
all.&nbsp; What is true of one hour before birth is true of two, 
and so on till we get back to the impregnate ovum, which may 
fairly claim to have been personally identical with the man of 
eighty into which it ultimately developed, in spite of the fact 
that there is no particle of same matter nor sense of continuity 
between them, nor recognised community of instinct, nor indeed of
anything which on a <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> view of the matter 
goes to the making up of that which we call identity.</p>
<p>There is far more of all these things common to the impregnate
ovum and the ovum immediately before impregnation, or again 
between the impregnate ovum, and both the ovum before 
impregnation and the spermatozoon which impregnated it.&nbsp; 
Nor, if we admit <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>personal identity between the ovum 
and the octogenarian, is there any sufficient reason why we 
should not admit it between the impregnate ovum and the two 
factors of which it is composed, which two factors are but 
offshoots from two distinct personalities, of which they are as 
much part as the apple is of the apple-tree; so that an 
impregnate ovum cannot without a violation of first principles be
debarred from claiming personal identity with both its parents, 
and hence, by an easy chain of reasoning, <i>with each of the 
impregnate ova from which its parents were developed</i>.</p>
<p>So that each ovum when impregnate should be considered not as 
descended from its ancestors, but as being a continuation of the 
personality of every ovum in the chain of its ancestry, every 
which ovum <i>it actually is</i> as truly as the octogenarian 
<i>is</i> the same identity with the ovum from which he has been 
developed.&nbsp; The two cases stand or fall together.</p>
<p>This process cannot stop short of the primordial cell, which 
again will probably turn out to be but a brief 
resting-place.&nbsp; We therefore prove each one of us to <i>be 
actually</i> the primordial cell which never died nor dies, but 
has differentiated itself into the life of the world, all living 
beings whatever, being one with it, and members one of 
another.</p>
<p>To look at the matter for a moment in another light, it will 
be admitted that if the primordial cell had been killed before 
leaving issue, all its possible descendants would have been 
killed at one and the same time.&nbsp; It is hard to see how this
single fact does not establish at the point, as it were, of a 
logical bayonet, an identity between any creature and all others 
that are descended from it.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>The fencing (for it does not deserve the name of 
serious disputation) with which Bishop Butler meets his opponents
is rendered possible by the laxness with which the words 
&ldquo;identical&rdquo; and &ldquo;identity&rdquo; are ordinarily
used.&nbsp; Bishop Butler would not seriously deny that 
personality undergoes great changes between infancy and old age, 
and hence that it must undergo some change from moment to 
moment.&nbsp; So universally is this recognised, that it is 
common to hear it said of such and such a man that he is not at 
all the person he was, or of such and such another that he is 
twice the man he used to be&mdash;expressions than which none 
nearer the truth can well be found.&nbsp; On the other hand, 
those whom Bishop Butler is intending to confute would be the 
first to admit that, though there are many changes between 
infancy and old age, yet they come about in any one individual 
under such circumstances as we are all agreed in considering as 
the factors of personal identity rather than as hindrances 
thereto&mdash;that is to say that there has been no entire and 
permanent death on the part of the individual between any two 
phases of his existence, and that any one phase has had a lasting
though perhaps imperceptible effect upon all succeeding 
ones.&nbsp; So that no one ever seriously argued in the manner 
supposed by Bishop Butler, unless with modifications and saving 
clauses, to which it does not suit his purpose to call 
attention.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>No doubt it would be more strictly accurate to say &ldquo;you 
are the now phase of the person I met last night,&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;you are the being which has been evolved from the being I 
met last night,&rdquo; than &ldquo;you are the person I met last 
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; But life is too short for the periphrases 
which would crowd upon us from every <!-- page 114--><a 
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>quarter, if
we did not set our face against all that is under the surface of 
things, unless, that is to say, the going beneath the surface is,
for some special chance of profit, excusable or capable of 
extenuation.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Take again the case of some weeping trees, whose boughs spring
up into fresh trees when they have reached the ground, who shall 
say at what time they cease to be members of the parent 
tree?&nbsp; In the case of cuttings from plants it is easy to 
elude the difficulty by making a parade of the sharp and sudden 
act of separation from the parent stock, but this is only a piece
of mental sleight of hand; the cutting remains as much part of 
its parent plant as though it had never been severed from it; it 
goes on profiting by the experience which it had before it was 
cut off, as much as though it had never been cut off at 
all.&nbsp; This will be more readily seen in the case of worms 
which have been cut in half.&nbsp; Let a worm be cut in half, and
the two halves will become fresh worms; which of them is the 
original worm?&nbsp; Surely both.&nbsp; Perhaps no simpler cage 
than this could readily be found of the manner in which 
personality eludes us, the moment we try to investigate its real 
nature.&nbsp; There are few ideas which on first consideration 
appear so simple, and none which becomes more utterly incapable 
of limitation or definition as soon as it is examined 
closely.</p>
<p>It has gone the way of species.&nbsp; It is now generally held
that species blend or have blended into one another; so that any 
possibility of arrangement and apparent subdivision into definite
groups, is due to the suppression by death both of individuals 
and whole genera, which, had they been now existing, would have 
linked all living beings by a series of gradations so subtle that
<!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
115</span>little classification could have been attempted.&nbsp; 
What we have failed to see is that the individual is as much 
linked onto other individuals as the species is linked on to 
other species.&nbsp; How it is that the one great personality of 
life as a whole, should have split itself up into so many centres
of thought and action, each one of which is wholly, or at any 
rate nearly unconscious of its connection with the other members,
instead of having grown up into a huge polyp, or as it were coral
reef or compound animal over the whole world, which should be 
conscious but of its own one single existence; how it is that the
daily waste of this creature should be carried on by the 
conscious death of its individual members, instead of by the 
unconscious waste of tissue which goes on in the bodies of each 
individual (if indeed the tissue which we waste daily in our own 
bodies is so unconscious of its birth and death as we suppose); 
how, again, that the daily repair of this huge creature life 
should have become decentralised, and be carried on by conscious 
reproduction on the part of its component items, instead of by 
the unconscious nutrition of the whole from a single centre, as 
the nutrition of our own bodies would appear (though perhaps 
falsely) to be carried on; these are matters upon which I dare 
not speculate here, but on which some reflections may follow in 
subsequent chapters.</p>
<h3><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>INSTINCT AS INHERITED MEMORY.&nbsp; 
(<span class="smcap">chapter xi. of life and habit</span>.)</h3>
<p>Obviously the memory of a habit or experience will not 
commonly be transmitted to offspring in that perfection which is 
called &ldquo;instinct,&rdquo; till the habit or experience has 
been repeated in several generations with more or less 
uniformity; for otherwise the impression made will not be strong 
enough to endure through the busy and difficult task of 
reproduction.&nbsp; This of course involves that the habit shall 
have attained, as it were, equilibrium with the creature&rsquo;s 
sense of its own needs, so that it shall have long seemed the 
best course possible, leaving upon the whole and under ordinary 
circumstances little further to be desired, and hence that it 
should have been little varied during many generations.&nbsp; We 
should expect that it would be transmitted in a more or less 
partial, varying, imperfect, and intelligent condition before 
equilibrium had been attained; it would, however, continually 
tend towards equilibrium.</p>
<p>When this stage has been reached, as regards any habit, the 
creature will cease trying to improve; on which the repetition of
the habit will become stable, and hence capable of more unerring 
transmission&mdash;but at the same time improvement will cease; 
the habit will become fixed, and be perhaps transmitted at <!-- 
page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
117</span>an earlier and earlier age, till it has reached that 
date of manifestation which shall be found most agreeable to the 
other habits of the creature.&nbsp; It will also be manifested, 
as a matter of course, without further consciousness or 
reflection, for people cannot be always opening up settled 
questions; if they thought a matter all over yesterday they 
cannot think it all over again to-day, what they thought then 
they will think now, and will act upon their opinion; and this, 
too, even in spite sometimes of misgiving, that if they were to 
think still further they could find a still better course.&nbsp; 
It is not, therefore, to be expected that &ldquo;instinct&rdquo; 
should show signs of that hesitating and tentative action which 
results from knowledge that is still so imperfect as to be 
actively self-conscious; nor yet that it should grow or vary 
perceptibly unless under such changed conditions as shall baffle 
memory, and present the alternative of either 
invention&mdash;that is to say, variation&mdash;or death.</p>
<p>But every instinct must have passed through the laboriously 
intelligent stages through which human civilisations <i>and 
mechanical inventions</i> are now passing; and he who would study
the origin of an instinct with its development, partial 
transmission, further growth, further transmission, approach to 
more unreflecting stability, and finally, its perfection as an 
unerring and unerringly transmitted instinct, must look to laws, 
customs, <i>and machinery</i> as his best instructors.&nbsp; 
Customs and machines are instincts <i>and organs</i> now in 
process of development; they will assuredly one day reach the 
unconscious state of equilibrium which we observe in the 
structures and instincts of bees and ants, and an approach to 
which may be found among some savage nations.&nbsp; We may 
reflect, however, not without pleasure, <!-- page 118--><a 
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>that this 
condition&mdash;the true millennium&mdash;is still distant.&nbsp;
Nevertheless the ants and bees seem happy; perhaps more happy 
than when so many social questions were in as hot discussion 
among them as other and not dissimilar ones will one day be 
amongst ourselves.</p>
<p>And this, as will be apparent, opens up the whole question of 
the stability of species, which we cannot follow further here, 
than to say, that according to the balance of testimony, many 
plants and animals do appear to have reached a phase of being 
from which they are hard to move&mdash;that is to say, they will 
die sooner than be at the pains of altering their 
habits&mdash;true martyrs to their convictions.&nbsp; Such races 
refuse to see changes in their surroundings as long as they can, 
but when compelled to recognise them, they throw up the game 
because they cannot and will not, or will not and cannot, 
invent.</p>
<p>This is perfectly intelligible, for a race is nothing but a 
long-lived individual, and like any individual, or tribe of men 
whom we have yet observed, will have its special capacities and 
its special limitations, though, as in the case of the 
individual, so also with the race, it is exceedingly hard to say 
what those limitations are, and why, having been able to go so 
far, it should go no further.&nbsp; Every man and every race is 
capable of education up to a certain point, but not to the extent
of being made from a sow&rsquo;s ear into a silk purse.&nbsp; The
proximate cause of the limitation seems to lie in the absence of 
the wish to go further; the presence or absence of the wish will 
depend upon the nature and surroundings of the individual, which 
is simply a way of saying that one can get no further, but that 
as the song (with a slight alteration) says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span

<p>M. Ribot in his work on Heredity <a name="citation119"></a><a 
href="#footnote119" class="citation">[119]</a> writes (p. 
14):&mdash;&ldquo;The duckling hatched by the hen makes straight 
for water.&rdquo;&nbsp; In what conceivable way can we account 
for this, except on the supposition that the duckling knows 
perfectly well what it can and what it cannot do with water, 
owing to its recollection of what it did when it was still one 
individuality with its parents, and hence, when it was a duckling
before?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The squirrel, before it knows anything of winter, lays 
up a store of nuts.&nbsp; A bird when hatched in a cage will, 
when given its freedom, build for itself a nest like that of its 
parents, out of the same materials, and of the same 
shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this is not due to memory, &ldquo;even an imperfect&rdquo; 
explanation of what else it can be due to, &ldquo;would,&rdquo; 
to quote from Mr. Darwin, &ldquo;be satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intelligence gropes about, tries this way and that, 
misses its object, commits mistakes, and corrects 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Because intelligence is of consciousness, and 
consciousness is of attention, and attention is of uncertainty, 
and uncertainty is of ignorance or want of consciousness.&nbsp; 
Intelligence is not yet thoroughly up to its business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct advances with a mechanical certainty, hence 
comes its unconscious character.&nbsp; It knows nothing either of
ends, or of the means of attaining them: it implies no 
comparison, judgment, or choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is assumption.&nbsp; What is certain is that instinct 
does not betray signs of self-consciousness as to its own <!-- 
page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
120</span>knowledge.&nbsp; It has dismissed reference to first 
principles, and is no longer under the law, but under the grace 
of a settled conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All seems directed by thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes; because all <i>has been</i> in earlier existences 
directed by thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without ever arriving at thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because it has <i>got past thought</i>, and though 
&ldquo;directed by thought&rdquo; originally, is now travelling 
in exactly the opposite direction.&nbsp; It is not likely to 
reach thought again, till people get to know worse and worse how 
to do things, the oftener they practise them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if this phenomenon appear strange, it must be 
observed that analogous states occur in ourselves.&nbsp; <i>All 
that we do from habit</i>&mdash;<i>walking</i>, <i>writing</i>, 
<i>or practising a mechanical act</i>, <i>for 
instance</i>&mdash;<i>all these and many other very complex acts 
are performed without consciousness</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct appears stationary.&nbsp; It does not, like 
intelligence, seem to grow and decay, to gain and to lose.&nbsp; 
It does not improve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally.&nbsp; For improvement can only as a general rule be
looked for along the line of latest development, that is to say, 
in matters concerning which the creature is being still 
consciously exercised.&nbsp; Older questions are settled, and the
solution must be accepted as final, for the question of living at
all would be reduced to an absurdity, if everything decided upon 
one day was to be undecided again the next; as with painting or 
music, so with life and politics, let every man be fully 
persuaded in his own mind, for decision with wrong will be 
commonly a better policy than indecision&mdash;I had almost added
with right; and a firm purpose with risk will be better than an 
infirm one with temporary <!-- page 121--><a 
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>exemption 
from disaster.&nbsp; Every race has made its great blunders, to 
which it has nevertheless adhered, inasmuch as the corresponding 
modification of other structures and instincts was found 
preferable to the revolution which would be caused by a radical 
change of structure, with consequent havoc among a legion of 
vested interests.&nbsp; Rudimentary organs are, as has been often
said, the survivals of these interests&mdash;the signs of their 
peaceful and gradual extinction as living faiths; they are also 
instances of the difficulty of breaking through any cant or trick
which we have long practised, and which is not sufficiently 
troublesome to make it a serious object with us to cure ourselves
of the habit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it does not remain perfectly invariable, at least it
only varies within very narrow limits; and though this question 
has been warmly debated in our day and is yet unsettled, we may 
yet say that in instinct immutability is the law, variation the 
exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is quite as it should be.&nbsp; Genius will occasionally 
rise a little above convention, but with an old convention 
immutability will be the rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such,&rdquo; continues M. Ribot, &ldquo;are the 
admitted characters of instinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes; but are they not also the admitted characters of habitual
actions that are due to memory?</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>M. Ribot says a little further on: &ldquo;Originally man had 
considerable trouble in taming the animals which are now 
domesticated; and his work would have been in vain had not 
heredity&rdquo; (memory) &ldquo;come to his aid.&nbsp; It may be 
said that after man has modified a wild animal to his will, there
goes on in its progeny a silent conflict between two 
heredities&rdquo; (memories), &ldquo;the one tending to fix the 
acquired modifications and the other <!-- page 122--><a 
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>to preserve
the primitive instincts.&nbsp; The latter often get the mastery, 
and only after several generations is training sure of 
victory.&nbsp; But we may see that in either case heredity&rdquo;
(memory) &ldquo;always asserts its rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How marvellously is the above passage elucidated and made to 
fit in with the results of our recognised experience, by the 
simple substitution of the word &ldquo;memory&rdquo; for 
heredity.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>I cannot refrain from bringing forward a few more instances of
what I think must be considered by every reader as hereditary 
memory.&nbsp; Sydney Smith writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir James Hall hatched some chickens in an oven.&nbsp; 
Within a few minutes after the shell was broken, a spider was 
turned loose before this very youthful brood; the destroyer of 
flies had hardly proceeded more than a few inches, before he was 
descried by one of these oven-born chickens, and, at one peck of 
his bill, immediately devoured.&nbsp; This certainly was not 
imitation.&nbsp; A female goat very near delivery died; Galen cut
out the young kid, and placed before it a bundle of hay, a bunch 
of fruit, and a pan of milk; the young kid smelt to them all very
attentively, and then began to lap the milk.&nbsp; This was not 
imitation.&nbsp; And what is commonly and rightly called 
instinct, cannot be explained away under the notion of its being 
imitation.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Lecture xvii. on Moral Philosophy.)</p>
<p>It cannot, indeed, be explained away under the notion of its 
being imitation, but I think it may well be so under that of its 
being memory.</p>
<p>Again, a little further on in the same lecture as that above 
quoted from, we find:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&ldquo;Ants and beavers lay up magazines.&nbsp; Where 
do they get their knowledge that it will not be so easy to 
collect food in rainy weather as it is in summer?&nbsp; Men and 
women know these things, because their grandpapas and grandmammas
have told them so.&nbsp; Ants hatched from the egg artificially, 
or birds hatched in this manner, have all this knowledge by 
intuition, without the smallest communication with any of their 
relations.&nbsp; Now observe what the solitary wasp does; she 
digs several holes in the sand, in each of which she deposits an 
egg, though she certainly knows not (?) that an animal is 
deposited in that egg, and still less that this animal must be 
nourished with other animals.&nbsp; She collects a few green 
flies, rolls them up neatly in several parcels (like Bologna 
sausages), and stuffs one parcel into each hole where an egg is 
deposited.&nbsp; When the wasp worm is hatched, it finds a store 
of provision ready made; and what is most curious, the quantity 
allotted to each is exactly sufficient to support it, till it 
attains the period of wasphood, and can provide for itself.&nbsp;
This instinct of the parent wasp is the more remarkable as it 
does not feed upon flesh itself.&nbsp; Here the little creature 
has never seen its parent; for by the time it is born, the parent
is always eaten by sparrows; and yet, without the slightest 
education, or previous experience, it does everything that the 
parent did before it.&nbsp; Now the objectors to the doctrine of 
instinct may say what they please, but young tailors have no 
intuitive method of making pantaloons; a new-born mercer cannot 
measure diaper; nature teaches a cook&rsquo;s daughter nothing 
about sippets.&nbsp; All these things require with us seven 
years&rsquo; apprenticeship; but insects are like 
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s persons of quality&mdash;they know 
everything (as Moli&egrave;re says) without having learnt 
anything.&nbsp; <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>&lsquo;Les gens de qualit&eacute; 
savent tout, sans avoir rien appris.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>How completely all difficulty vanishes from the facts so 
pleasantly told in this passage when we bear in mind the true 
nature of personal identity, the ordinary working of memory, and 
the vanishing tendency of consciousness concerning what we know 
exceedingly well.</p>
<p>My last instance I take from M. Ribot, who 
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Gratiolet, in his <i>Anatomie 
Compar&eacute;e du Syst&egrave;ms Nerveux</i>, states that an old
piece of wolf&rsquo;s skin, with the hair all worn away, when set
before a little dog, threw the animal into convulsions of fear by
the slight scent attaching to it.&nbsp; The dog had never seen a 
wolf, and we can only explain this alarm by the hereditary 
transmission of certain sentiments, coupled with a certain 
perception of the sense of smell.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
(&ldquo;Heredity,&rdquo; p. 43.)</p>
<p>I should prefer to say &ldquo;we can only explain the alarm by
supposing that the smell of the wolf&rsquo;s 
skin&rdquo;&mdash;the sense of smell being, as we all know, more 
powerful to recall the ideas that have been associated with it 
than any other sense&mdash;&ldquo;brought up the ideas with which
it had been associated in the dog&rsquo;s mind during many 
previous existences&rdquo;&mdash;he on smelling the wolf&rsquo;s 
skin remembering all about wolves perfectly well.</p>
<h3><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>CONCLUDING REMARKS.&nbsp; (<span 
class="smcap">from chapter xv. of life and habit</span>.)</h3>
<p>Here, then, I leave my case, though well aware that I have 
crossed the threshold only of my subject.&nbsp; My work is of a 
tentative character, put before the public as a sketch or design 
for a, possibly, further endeavour, in which I hope to derive 
assistance from the criticisms which this present volume may 
elicit. <a name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125" 
class="citation">[125]</a>&nbsp; Such as it is, however, for the 
present I must leave it.</p>
<p>We have seen that we cannot do anything thoroughly till we can
do it unconsciously, and that we cannot do anything unconsciously
till we can do it thoroughly; this at first seems illogical; but 
logic and consistency are luxuries for the gods, and the lower 
animals, only.&nbsp; Thus a boy cannot really know how to swim 
till he can swim, but he cannot swim till he knows how to 
swim.&nbsp; Conscious effort is but the process of rubbing off 
the rough corners from these two contradictory statements, till 
they eventually fit into one another so closely that it is 
impossible to disjoin them.</p>
<p>Whenever we see any creature able to go through any 
complicated and difficult process with little or no 
effort&mdash;whether it be a bird building her nest, or a <!-- 
page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
126</span>hen&rsquo;s egg making itself into a chicken, or an 
ovum turning itself into a baby&mdash;we may conclude that the 
creature has done the same thing on a very great number of past 
occasions.</p>
<p>We found the phenomena exhibited by heredity to be so like 
those of memory, and to be so inexplicable on any other 
supposition than that they were modes of memory, that it was 
easier to suppose them due to memory in spite of the fact that we
cannot remember having recollected, than to believe that because 
we cannot so remember, therefore the phenomena cannot be due to 
memory.</p>
<p>We were thus led to consider &ldquo;personal identity,&rdquo; 
in order to see whether there was sufficient reason for denying 
that the experience, which we must have clearly gained somewhere,
was gained by us when we were in the persons of our forefathers; 
we found, not without surprise, that unless we admitted that it 
might be so gained, in so far as that we once <i>actually 
were</i> our remotest ancestor, we must change our ideas 
concerning personality altogether.</p>
<p>We therefore assumed that the phenomena of heredity, whether 
as regards instinct or structure, were due to memory of past 
experiences, accumulated and fused till they had become 
automatic, or quasi automatic, much in the same way as after a 
long life&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . &ldquo;Old experience doth attain<br />
To something like prophetic strain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After dealing with certain phenomena of memory, but more 
especially with its abeyance and revival, we inquired what the 
principal corresponding phenomena of life and species should be, 
on the hypothesis that they were mainly due to memory.</p>
<p>I think I may say that we found the hypothesis fit <!-- page 
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>in
with actual facts in a sufficiently satisfactory manner.&nbsp; We
found not a few matters, as, for example, the sterility of 
hybrids, the principle underlying longevity, the phenomena of old
age, and puberty as generally near the end of development, 
explain themselves with more completeness than I have yet heard 
of their being explained on any other hypothesis.&nbsp; Most 
indeed of these phenomena have been left hitherto without even an
attempt at an explanation.</p>
<p>We considered the most important difficulty in the way of 
instinct as hereditary habit, namely, the structure and instincts
of neuter insects; these are very unlike those of their parents, 
and cannot, apparently, be transmitted to offspring by 
individuals of the previous generation, in whom such structure 
and instincts appeared, inasmuch as these creatures are 
sterile.&nbsp; I do not say that the difficulty is wholly 
removed, inasmuch as some obscurity must be admitted to remain as
to the manner in which the structure of the larva is aborted; 
this obscurity is likely to remain till we know more of the early
history of civilisation among bees than I can find that we know 
at present; but I believe the difficulty was reduced to such 
proportions as to make it little likely to be felt in comparison 
with that of attributing instinct to any other cause than 
inherited habit, or memory on the part of offspring, of habits 
contracted in the persons of its ancestors. <a 
name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127" 
class="citation">[127]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>We then inquired what was the great principle 
underlying variation, and answered, with Lamarck, that it must be
&ldquo;sense of need;&rdquo; and though not without being haunted
by suspicion of a vicious circle, and also well aware that we 
were not much nearer the origin of life than when we started, we 
still concluded that here was the truest origin of species, and 
hence of genera; and that the accumulation of variations, which 
in time amounted to specific and generic differences, was due to 
intelligence and memory on the part of the creature varying, 
rather than to the operation of what Mr. Darwin has called 
&ldquo;natural selection.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the same time we 
admitted that the course of nature is very much as Mr. Darwin has
represented it, in this respect, in so far as that there is a 
struggle for existence, and that the weaker must go to the 
wall.&nbsp; But we denied that this part of the course of nature 
would lead to much, if any, accumulation of variation, unless the
variation was directed mainly by intelligent sense of need, with 
continued personality and memory.</p>
<p>We conclude, therefore, that the small, apparently 
structureless, impregnate ovum from which we have each one of us 
sprung, has a potential recollection of all that has happened to 
each one of its ancestors prior to the period at which any such 
ancestor has issued from the bodies of its 
progenitors&mdash;provided, that is to say, a sufficiently deep, 
or sufficiently often-repeated, impression has been made to admit
of its being remembered at all.</p>
<p>Each step of normal development will lead the impregnate ovum 
up to, and remind it of, its next ordinary course of action, in 
the same way as we, when we recite a well-known passage, are led 
up to each successive <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>sentence by the sentence which has 
immediately preceded it.</p>
<p>And for this reason, namely, that as it takes two people 
&ldquo;to tell&rdquo; a thing&mdash;a speaker and a comprehending
listener, without which last, though much may have been said, 
there has been nothing told&mdash;so also it takes two people, as
it were, to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; a thing&mdash;the creature 
remembering, and the surroundings of the creature at the time it 
last remembered.&nbsp; Hence, though the ovum immediately after 
impregnation is instinct with all the memories of both parents, 
not one of these memories can normally become active till both 
the ovum itself, and its surroundings, are sufficiently like what
they respectively were, when the occurrence now to be remembered 
last took place.&nbsp; The memory will then immediately return, 
and the creature will do as it did on the last occasion that it 
was in like case as now.&nbsp; This ensures that similarity of 
order shall be preserved in all the stages of development in 
successive generations.</p>
<p>Life then is the being possessed of memory.&nbsp; We are all 
the same stuff to start with; plants and animals only differ from
one another because they remember different things; they grow up 
in the shapes they bear because these shapes are the embodiments 
of their ideas concerning their own past history; they are forms 
of faith or faiths of form whichever the reader chooses.</p>
<p>Hence the term &ldquo;Natural History,&rdquo; as applied to 
the different plants and animals around us.&nbsp; For surely the 
study of natural history means only the study of plants and 
animals themselves, which, at the moment of using the words 
&ldquo;Natural History,&rdquo; we assume to be the most important
part of nature.</p>
<p>A living creature well supported by a mass of healthy 
ancestral memory is a young and growing creature, free <!-- page 
130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
130</span>from ache or pain, and thoroughly acquainted with its 
business so far, but with much yet to be reminded of.&nbsp; A 
creature which finds itself and its surroundings not so unlike 
those of its parents about the time of their begetting it, as to 
be compelled to recognise that it never yet was in any such 
position, is a creature in the heyday of life.&nbsp; A creature 
which begins to be aware of itself is one which is beginning to 
recognise that the situation is a new one.</p>
<p>It is the young and fair, then, who are the truly old and 
truly experienced; it is they who alone have a trustworthy memory
to guide them; they alone know things as they are, and it is from
them that, as we grow older, we must study if we would still 
cling to truth.&nbsp; The whole charm of youth lies in its 
advantage over age in respect of experience, and where this has 
for some reason failed, or been misapplied, the charm is 
broken.&nbsp; When we say that we are getting old, we should say 
rather that we are getting new or young, and are suffering from 
inexperience, which drives us into doing things which we do not 
understand, and lands us, eventually, in the utter impotence of 
death.&nbsp; The kingdom of heaven is the kingdom of little 
children.</p>

<h3>IMPOTENCE OF PALEY&rsquo;S CONCLUSION.&nbsp; THE TELEOLOGY OF
THE EVOLUTIONIST.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">from chapter iii. of
evolution</span>, <span class="smcap">old and new</span>.)</h3>
<p>If we conceive of ourselves as looking simultaneously upon a 
real foot, and upon an admirably constructed artificial one, 
placed by the side of it, the idea of design, and design by an 
intelligent living being with a body and soul (without which, the
use of the word design is delusive), will present itself strongly
to our minds in connection both with the true foot and with the 
model; but we find another idea asserting itself with even 
greater strength, namely, that the design of the true foot is 
infinitely more intricate, and yet is carried into execution in 
far more masterly manner than that of the model.&nbsp; We not 
only feel that there is a wider difference between the ability, 
time, and care which have been lavished on the real foot and upon
the model, than there is between the skill and the time taken to 
produce Westminster Abbey, and that bestowed upon a gingerbread 
cake stuck with sugar plums so as to represent it, but also that 
these two objects must have been manufactured on different 
principles.&nbsp; We do not for a moment doubt that the real foot
was designed, but we are so astonished at the dexterity of <!-- 
page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
132</span>the designer that we are at a loss for some time to 
think who could have designed it, where he can live, in what 
manner he studied, for how long, and by what processes he carried
out his design, when matured, into actual practice.&nbsp; Until 
recently it was thought that there was no answer to many of these
questions, more especially to those which bear upon the mode of 
manufacture.&nbsp; For the last hundred years, however, the 
importance of a study has been recognised which does actually 
reveal to us in no small degree the processes by which the human 
foot is manufactured, so that in our endeavour to lay our hands 
upon the points of difference between the kind of design with 
which the foot itself is designed, and the design of the model, 
we turn naturally to the guidance of those who have made this 
study their specialty; and a very wide difference does this 
study, embryology, at once reveal to us.</p>
<p>Writing of the successive changes through which each embryo is
forced to pass, the late Mr. G. H. Lewes says that &ldquo;none of
these phases have any adaptation to the future state of the 
animal, but are in positive contradiction to it or are simply 
purposeless; whereas all show stamped on them the unmistakable 
characters of <i>ancestral</i> adaptation, and the progressions 
of organic evolution.&nbsp; What does the fact imply?&nbsp; There
is not a single known example of a complex organism which is not 
developed out of simpler forms.&nbsp; Before it can attain the 
complex structure which distinguishes it, there must be an 
evolution of forms similar to those which distinguish the 
structure of organisms lower in the series.&nbsp; On the 
hypothesis of a plan which prearranged the organic world, nothing
could be more unworthy of a supreme intelligence than this 
inability to construct an organism at once, without making 
several <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>previous tentative efforts, undoing 
to-day what was so carefully done yesterday, and <i>repeating for
centuries the same tentatives in the same succession</i>.&nbsp; 
Do not let us blink this consideration.&nbsp; There is a 
traditional phrase much in vogue among the anthropomorphists, 
which arose naturally enough from a tendency to take human 
methods as an explanation of the Divine&mdash;a phrase which 
becomes a sort of argument&mdash;&lsquo;The Great 
Architect.&rsquo;&nbsp; But if we are to admit the human point of
view, a glance at the facts of embryology must produce very 
uncomfortable reflections.&nbsp; For what should we say to an 
architect who was unable, or being able was obstinately 
unwilling, to erect a palace except by first using his materials 
in the shape of a hut, then pulling them down and rebuilding them
as a cottage, then adding story to story and room to room, 
<i>not</i> with any reference to the ultimate purposes of the 
palace, but wholly with reference to the way in which houses were
constructed in ancient times?&nbsp; What should we say to the 
architect who could not form a museum out of bricks and mortar, 
but was forced to begin as if going to construct a mansion, and 
after proceeding some way in this direction, altered his plan 
into a palace, and that again into a museum?&nbsp; Yet this is 
the sort of succession on which organisms are constructed.&nbsp; 
The fact has long been familiar; how has it been reconciled with 
infinite wisdom?&nbsp; Let the following passage answer for a 
thousand:&mdash;&lsquo;The embryo is nothing like the miniature 
of the adult.&nbsp; For a long while the body in its entirety and
in its details, presents the strangest of spectacles.&nbsp; Day 
by day and hour by hour, the aspect of the scene changes, and 
this instability is exhibited by the most essential parts no less
than by the accessory parts.&nbsp; One would say that nature 
feels her <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>way, and only reaches the goal after
many times missing the path&rsquo; (on dirait que la nature 
t&acirc;tonne et ne conduit son &oelig;uvre &agrave; bon fin, 
qu&rsquo;apr&egrave;s s&rsquo;&ecirc;tre souvent 
tromp&eacute;e).&rdquo; <a name="citation134a"></a><a 
href="#footnote134a" class="citation">[134a]</a></p>
<p>The above passage does not, I think, affect the evidence for 
design which we adduced in the preceding chapter. <a 
name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b" 
class="citation">[134b]</a>&nbsp; However strange the process of 
manufacture may appear, when the work comes to be turned out the 
design is too manifest to be doubted.</p>
<p>If the reader were to come upon some lawyer&rsquo;s deed which
dealt with matters of such unspeakable intricacy that it baffled 
his imagination to conceive how it could ever have been drafted, 
and if in spite of this he were to find the intricacy of the 
provisions to be made, exceeded only by the ease and simplicity 
with which the deed providing for them was found to work in 
practice; and after this, if he were to discover that the deed, 
by whomsoever drawn, had nevertheless been drafted upon 
principles which at first seemed very foreign to any according to
which he was in the habit of drafting deeds himself, as for 
example, that the draftsman had begun to draft a will as a 
marriage settlement, and so forth&mdash;yet an observer would 
not, I take it, do either of two things.&nbsp; He would not in 
the face of the result deny the design, making himself judge 
rather of the method of procedure than of the achievement.&nbsp; 
Nor yet after insisting in the manner of Paley, on the wonderful 
proofs of intention and on the exquisite provisions which were to
be found in every syllable&mdash;thus leading us up to the 
highest pitch of expectation&mdash;<!-- page 135--><a 
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>would he 
present us with such an impotent conclusion as that the designer,
though a living person and a true designer, was yet immaterial 
and intangible, a something, in fact, which proves to be a 
nothing; an omniscient and omnipotent vacuum.</p>
<p>Our observer would feel he need not have been at such pains to
establish his design if this was to be the upshot of his 
reasoning.&nbsp; He would therefore admit the design, and by 
consequence the designer, but would probably ask a little time 
for reflection before he ventured to say who, or what, or where 
the designer was.&nbsp; Then gaining some insight into the manner
in which the deed had been drawn, he would conclude that the 
draftsman was a specialist who had had long practice in this 
particular kind of work, but who now worked almost as it might be
said automatically and without consciousness, and found it 
difficult to depart from a habitual method of procedure.</p>
<p>We turn, then, on Paley, and say to him: &ldquo;We have 
admitted your design and your designer.&nbsp; Where is he?&nbsp; 
Show him to us.&nbsp; If you cannot show him to us as flesh and 
blood, show him as flesh and sap; show him as a living cell; show
him as protoplasm.&nbsp; Lower than this we should not fairly go;
it is not in the bond or <i>nexus</i> of our ideas that something
utterly inanimate and inorganic should scheme, design, contrive, 
and elaborate structures which can make mistakes: it may 
elaborate low unerring things, like crystals, but it cannot 
elaborate those which have the power to err.&nbsp; Nevertheless, 
we will commit such abuse with our understandings as to waive 
this point, and we will ask you to show him to us as air which, 
if it cannot be seen yet can be felt, weighed, handled, 
transferred from place to place, be judged by its effects, and so
forth; or <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>if this may not be, give us half a 
grain of hydrogen, diffused through all space and invested with 
some of the minor attributes of matter; or if you cannot do this,
give us an imponderable like electricity, or even the higher 
mathematics, but give us something or throw off the mask and tell
us fairly out that it is your paid profession to hoodwink us on 
this matter if you can, and that you are but doing your best to 
earn an honest living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may fancy Paley as turning the tables upon us and as 
saying; &ldquo;But you too have admitted a designer&mdash;you too
then must mean a designer with a body and soul, who must be 
somewhere to be found in space, and who must live in time.&nbsp; 
Where is this your designer?&nbsp; Can you show him more than I 
can?&nbsp; Can you lay your finger on him and demonstrate him so 
that a child shall see him and know him, and find what was 
heretofore an isolated idea concerning him, combine itself 
instantaneously with the idea of the designer, we will say, of 
the human foot, so that no power on earth shall henceforth tear 
those two ideas asunder?&nbsp; Surely if you cannot do this, you 
too are trifling with words, and abusing your own mind and that 
of your reader.&nbsp; Where, then, is your designer of man?&nbsp;
Who made him?&nbsp; And where, again, is your designer of beasts 
and birds, of fishes and of plants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our answer is simple enough; it is that we can and do point to
a living tangible person with flesh, blood, eyes, nose, ears, 
organs, senses, dimensions, who did of his own cunning after 
infinite proof of every kind of hazard and experiment scheme out 
and fashion each organ of the human body.&nbsp; This is the 
person whom we claim as the designer and artificer of that body, 
and he is the one of all others the best fitted for the task <!--
page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
137</span>by his antecedents, and his practical knowledge of the 
requirements of the case&mdash;for he is man himself.</p>
<p>Not man, the individual of any given generation, but man in 
the entirety of his existence from the dawn of life onwards to 
the present moment.&nbsp; In like manner we say that the designer
of all organisms is so incorporate with the organisms 
themselves&mdash;so lives, moves, and has its being in those 
organisms, and is so one with them&mdash;they in it, and it in 
them&mdash;that it is more consistent with reason and the common 
use of words to see the designer of each living form in the 
living form itself, than to look for its designer in some other 
place or person.</p>
<p>Thus we have a third alternative presented to us.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Darwin and his followers deny design, as having 
any appreciable share in the formation of organism at all.</p>
<p>Paley and the theologians insist on design, but upon a 
designer outside the universe and the organism.</p>
<p>The third opinion is that suggested in the first instance and 
carried out to a very high degree of development by Buffon.&nbsp;
It was improved, and indeed, made almost perfect by Dr. Erasmus 
Darwin, but too much neglected by him after he had put it 
forward.&nbsp; It was borrowed, as I think we may say with some 
confidence, from Dr. Darwin by Lamarck, and was followed up by 
him ardently thenceforth, during the remainder of his life, 
though somewhat less perfectly comprehended by him than it had 
been by Dr. Darwin.&nbsp; It is that the design which has 
designed organisms, has resided within, and been embodied in, the
organisms themselves.</p>
<h3><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>FAILURE OF THE FIRST EVOLUTIONISTS 
TO SEE THEIR POSITION AS TELEOLOGICAL.&nbsp; (<span 
class="smcap">chapter iv. of evolution</span>, <span 
class="smcap">old and new</span>.)</h3>
<p>It follows from the doctrine of Dr. Erasmus Darwin and 
Lamarck, if not from that of Buffon himself, that the majority of
organs are as purposive to the evolutionist as to the theologian,
and far more intelligibly so.&nbsp; Circumstances, however, 
prevented these writers from acknowledging this fact to the 
world, and perhaps even to themselves.&nbsp; Their <i>crux</i> 
was, as it still is to so many evolutionists, the presence of 
rudimentary organs, and the processes of embryological 
development.&nbsp; They would not admit that rudimentary and 
therefore useless organs were designed by a Creator to take their
place once and for ever as part of a scheme whose main idea was, 
that every animal structure was to serve some useful end in 
connection with its possessor.</p>
<p>This was the doctrine of final causes as then commonly held; 
in the face of rudimentary organs it was absurd.&nbsp; Buffon was
above all things else a plain matter of fact thinker, who refused
to go far beyond the obvious.&nbsp; Like all other profound 
writers, he was, if I may say so, profoundly superficial.&nbsp; 
He felt that the aim of research does not consist in the knowing 
this or that, but in the easing of the desire to know or 
understand more completely&mdash;in the peace of mind which 
passeth all understanding.&nbsp; His was the perfection of a 
healthy <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>mental organism by which over effort
is felt to be as vicious and contemptible as indolence.&nbsp; He 
knew this too well to know the grounds of his knowledge, but we 
smaller people who know it less completely, can see that such 
felicitous instinctive tempering together of the two great 
contradictory principles, love of effort and love of ease, has 
underlain every healthy step of all healthy growth, whether of 
vegetable or animal, from the earliest conceivable time to the 
present moment.&nbsp; Nothing is worth looking at which is seen 
either too obviously or with too much difficulty.&nbsp; Nothing 
is worth doing or well done which is not done fairly easily, and 
some little deficiency of effort is more pardonable than any very
perceptible excess, for virtue has ever erred on the side of 
self-indulgence rather than of asceticism.</p>
<p>According to Buffon, then&mdash;as also according to Dr. 
Darwin, who was just such another practical and genial thinker, 
and who was distinctly a pupil of Buffon, though a most 
intelligent and original one&mdash;if an organ after a reasonable
amount of inspection appeared to be useless, it was to be called 
useless without more ado, and theories were to be ordered out of 
court if they were troublesome.&nbsp; In like manner, if animals 
breed freely <i>inter se</i> before our eyes, as for example the 
horse and ass, the fact was to be noted, but no animals were to 
be classed as capable of interbreeding until they had asserted 
their right to such classification by breeding with tolerable 
certainty.&nbsp; If, again, an animal looked as if it felt, that 
is to say, if it moved about pretty quickly or made a noise, it 
must be held to feel; if it did neither of these things it did 
not look as if it felt, and therefore it must be said not to 
feel.&nbsp; <i>De non apparentibus et non existentibus eadem est 
</i><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 140</span><i>lex</i> was one of the chief 
axioms of their philosophy; no writers have had a greater horror 
of mystery or of ideas that have not become so mastered as to be,
or to have been, superficial.&nbsp; Lamarck was one of those men 
of whom I believe it has been said that they have brain upon the 
brain.&nbsp; He had his theory that an animal could not feel 
unless it had a nervous system, and at least a spinal 
marrow&mdash;and that it could not think at all without a 
brain&mdash;all his facts, therefore, have to be made to square 
with this.&nbsp; With Buffon and Dr. Darwin we feel safe that 
however wrong they may sometimes be, their conclusions have 
always been arrived at on that fairly superficial view of things 
in which, as I have elsewhere said, our nature alone permits us 
to be comforted.</p>
<p>To these writers, then, the doctrine of final causes for 
rudimentary organs was a piece of mystification and an absurdity;
no less fatal to any such doctrine were the processes of 
embryological development.&nbsp; It was plain that the commonly 
received teleology must be given up; but the idea of design or 
purpose was so associated in their minds with theological design 
that they avoided it altogether.&nbsp; They seem to have 
forgotten that an internal purpose is as much purpose as an 
external one; hence, unfortunately, though their whole theory of 
development is intensely purposive, it is the fact rather than 
the name of teleology which has hitherto been insisted upon, even
by the greatest writers on evolution&mdash;the name having been 
most persistently denied even by those who were most insisting on
the thing itself.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand the difficulty felt by the fathers of
evolution when we remember how much had to be seen before the 
facts could lie well before them.&nbsp; <!-- page 141--><a 
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>It was 
necessary to attain, firstly, to a perception of the unity of 
person between parents and offspring in successive generations; 
secondly, it must be seen that an organism&rsquo;s memory (within
the limitations to which all memory is subject) goes back for 
generations beyond its birth, to the first beginnings in fact, of
which we know anything whatever; thirdly, the latency of that 
memory, as of memory generally, till the associated ideas are 
reproduced, must be brought to bear upon the facts of heredity; 
and lastly, the unconsciousness with which habitual actions come 
to be performed, must be assigned as the explanation of the 
unconsciousness with which we grow and discharge most of our 
natural functions.</p>
<p>Buffon was too busy with the fact that animals descended with 
modification at all, to go beyond the development and 
illustration of this great truth.&nbsp; I doubt whether he ever 
saw more than the first, and that dimly, of the four 
considerations above stated.</p>
<p>Dr. Darwin was the first to point out the first two 
considerations; he did so with some clearness, but can hardly be 
said to have understood their full importance: the two latter 
ideas do not appear to have occurred to him.</p>
<p>Lamarck had little if any perception of any one of the 
four.&nbsp; When, however, they are firmly seized and brought 
into their due bearings one upon another, the facts of heredity 
become as simple as those of a man making a tobacco pipe, and 
rudimentary organs are seen to be essentially of the same 
character as the little rudimentary protuberance at the bottom of
the pipe to which I referred in &lsquo;Erewhon.&rsquo; <a 
name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141" 
class="citation">[141]</a></p>
<p>These organs are now no longer useful, but they <!-- page 
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
142</span>once were so, and were therefore once purposive, though
not so now.&nbsp; They are the expressions of a bygone 
usefulness; sayings, as it were, about which there was at one 
time infinite wrangling, as to what both the meaning and the 
expression should best be, so that they then had living 
significance in the mouths of those who used them, though they 
have become such mere shibboleths and cant formul&aelig; to 
ourselves that we think no more of their meaning than we do of 
Julius C&aelig;sar in the month of July.&nbsp; They continue to 
be reproduced through the force of habit, and through 
indisposition to get out of any familiar groove of action until 
it becomes too unpleasant for us to remain in it any 
longer.&nbsp; It has long been felt that embryology and 
rudimentary structures indicated community of descent.&nbsp; Dr. 
Darwin and Lamarck insisted on this, as have all subsequent 
writers on evolution; but the explanation why and how the 
structures come to be repeated&mdash;namely, that they are simply
examples of the force of habit&mdash;can only be perceived 
intelligently by those who admit such unity between parents and 
offspring as that the self-development of the latter can be 
properly called habitual (as being a repetition of an act by one 
and the same individual), and can only be fully sympathised with 
by those who recognise that if habit be admitted as the key to 
the fact at all, the unconscious manner in which the habit comes 
to be repeated is only of a piece with all our other observations
concerning habit.&nbsp; For the fuller development of the 
foregoing, I must refer the reader to my work &ldquo;Life and 
Habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The purposiveness, which even Dr. Darwin (and Lamarck still 
less) seems never to have quite recognised in spite of their 
having insisted so much on what amounts to the same thing, now 
comes into full view.&nbsp; <!-- page 143--><a 
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>It is seen 
that the organs external to the body, and those internal to it, 
are the second as much as the first, things which we have made 
for our own convenience, and with a prevision that we shall have 
need of them; the main difference between the manufacture of 
these two classes of organs being, that we have made the one kind
so often that we can no longer follow the processes whereby we 
make them, while the others are new things which we must make 
introspectively or not at all, and which are not yet so 
incorporate with our vitality as that we should think they grow 
instead of being manufactured.&nbsp; The manufacture of the tool,
and the manufacture of the living organ prove therefore to be but
two species of the same genus, which, though widely 
differentiated, have descended as it were from one common 
filament of desire and inventive faculty.&nbsp; The greater or 
less complexity of the organs goes for very little.&nbsp; It is 
only a question of the amount of intelligence and voluntary 
self-adaptation which we must admit, and this must be settled 
rather by an appeal to what we find in organism, and observe 
concerning it, than by what we may have imagined <i>&agrave; 
priori</i>.</p>
<p>Given a small speck of jelly with some power of slightly 
varying its actions in accordance with slightly varying 
circumstances and desires&mdash;given such a jelly-speck with a 
power of assimilating other matter, and thus of reproducing 
itself, given also that it should be possessed of a memory and a 
reproductive system, and we can show how the whole animal world 
can have descended it may be from an <i>am&oelig;ba</i> without 
interference from without, and how every organ in every creature 
is designed at first roughly and tentatively but finally 
fashioned with the most consummate <!-- page 144--><a 
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>perfection,
by the creature which has had need of that organ, which best knew
what it wanted, and was never satisfied till it had got that 
which was the best suited to its varying circumstances in their 
entirety.&nbsp; We can even show how, if it becomes worth the 
Ethiopian&rsquo;s while to try and change his skin, or the 
leopard&rsquo;s to change his spots, they can assuredly change 
them within a not unreasonable time and adapt their covering to 
their own will and convenience, and to that of none other; thus 
what is commonly conceived of as direct creation by God is moved 
back to a time and space inconceivable in their remoteness, while
the aim and design so obvious in nature are shown to be still at 
work around us, growing ever busier and busier, and advancing 
from day to day both in knowledge and power.</p>
<p>It was reserved for Mr. Charles Darwin and for those who have 
too rashly followed him to deny purpose as having had any share 
in the development of animal and vegetable organs; to see no 
evidence of design in those wonderful provisions which have been 
the marvel and delight of observers in all ages.&nbsp; The one 
who has drawn our attention more than perhaps any other living 
writer to those very marvels of co-adaptation, is the foremost to
maintain that they are the result not of desire and design, 
either within the creature or without it, but of blind chance, 
working no whither, and due but to the accumulation of 
innumerable lucky accidents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are men,&rdquo; writes Professor Tyndal in the 
<i>Nineteenth Century</i> for last November, <a 
name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144" 
class="citation">[144]</a> &ldquo;and by no means the minority, 
who, however wealthy in regard to facts, can never rise into the 
region of principles; <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>and they are sometimes intolerant of
those that can.&nbsp; They are formed to plod meritoriously on in
the lower levels of thought; unpossessed of the pinions necessary
to reach the heights, they cannot realise the mental 
act&mdash;the act of inspiration it might well be called&mdash;by
which a man of genius, after long pondering and proving, reaches 
a theoretic conception which unravels and illuminates the tangle 
of centuries of observation and experiment.&nbsp; There are 
minds, it may be said in passing, who, at the present moment, 
stand in this relation to Mr. Darwin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more rhapsodical parts of the above must go for what they 
are worth, but I should be sorry to think that what remains 
conveyed a censure which might fall justly on myself.&nbsp; As I 
read the earlier part of the passage I confess that I imagined 
the conclusion was going to be very different from what it proved
to be.&nbsp; Fresh from the study of the older men and also of 
Mr. Darwin himself, I failed to see that Mr. Darwin had 
&ldquo;unravelled and illuminated&rdquo; a tangled skein, but 
believed him, on the contrary, to have tangled and obscured what 
his predecessors had made in great part, if not wholly, 
plain.&nbsp; With the older writers, I had felt as though in the 
hands of men who wished to understand themselves and to make 
their reader understand them with the smallest possible 
exertion.&nbsp; The older men, if not in full daylight, at any 
rate saw in what quarter of the sky the dawn was breaking, and 
were looking steadily towards it.&nbsp; It is not they who have 
put their hands over their own eyes and ours, and who are crying 
out that there is no light, but chance and blindness 
everywhere.</p>

ORGANISM.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">chapter v. of

<p>I have stated the foregoing in what I take to be an extreme 
logical development, in order that the reader may more easily 
perceive the consequences of those premises which I am 
endeavouring to re-establish.&nbsp; But it must not be supposed 
that an animal or plant has ever conceived the idea of some organ
widely different from any it was yet possessed of, and has set 
itself to design it in detail and grow towards it.</p>
<p>The small jelly-speck, which we call the am&oelig;ba, has no 
organs save what it can extemporise as occasion arises.&nbsp; If 
it wants to get at anything, it thrusts out part of its jelly, 
which thus serves it as an arm or hand: when the arm has served 
its purpose, it is absorbed into the rest of the jelly, and has 
now to do the duty of a stomach by helping to wrap up what it has
just purveyed.&nbsp; The small round jelly-speck spreads itself 
out and envelops its food, so that the whole creature is now a 
stomach, and nothing but a stomach.&nbsp; Having digested its 
food, it again becomes a jelly-speck, and is again ready to turn 
part of itself into hand or foot as its next convenience may 
dictate.&nbsp; It is not to be believed that such a creature as 
this, which is probably just sensitive to light and nothing more,
should be able to form any conception of an eye <!-- page 
147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
147</span>and set itself to work to grow one, any more than it is
believable that he who first observed the magnifying power of a 
dew-drop, or even he who first constructed a rude lens, should 
have had any idea in his mind of Lord Rosse&rsquo;s telescope 
with all its parts and appliances.&nbsp; Nothing could be well 
conceived more foreign to experience and common sense.&nbsp; 
Animals and plants have travelled to their present forms as a man
has travelled to any one of his own most complicated 
inventions.&nbsp; Slowly, step by step, through many blunders and
mischances which have worked together for good to those that have
persevered in elasticity.&nbsp; They have travelled as man has 
travelled, with but little perception of a want till there was 
also some perception of a power, and with but little perception 
of a power till there was a dim sense of want; want stimulating 
power, and power stimulating want; and both so based upon each 
other that no one can say which is the true foundation, but 
rather that they must be both baseless and, as it were, meteoric 
in mid air.&nbsp; They have seen very little ahead of a present 
power or need, and have been then most moral, when most inclined 
to pierce a little into futurity, but also when most obstinately 
declining to pierce too far, and busy mainly with the 
present.&nbsp; They have been so far blindfolded that they could 
see but for a few steps in front of them, yet so far free to see 
that those steps were taken with aim and definitely, and not in 
the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plus il a su,&rdquo; says Buffon, speaking of man, 
&ldquo;plus il a pu, mais aussi moins il a fait, moins il a 
su.&rdquo;&nbsp; This holds good wherever life holds good.&nbsp; 
Wherever there is life there is a moral government of rewards and
punishments understood by the am&oelig;ba neither <!-- page 
148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
148</span>better nor worse than by man.&nbsp; The history of 
organic development is the history of a moral struggle.</p>
<p>As for the origin of a creature able to feel want and power 
and as to what want and power spring from, we know nothing as 
yet, nor does it seem worth while to go into this question until 
an understanding has been come to as to whether the interaction 
of want and power in some low form or forms of life which could 
assimilate matter, reproduce themselves, vary their actions, and 
be capable of remembering, will or will not suffice to explain 
the development of the varied organs and desires which we see in 
the higher vertebrates and man.&nbsp; When this question has been
settled, then it will be time to push our inquiries farther 
back.</p>
<p>But given such a low form of life as here postulated, and 
there is no force in Paley&rsquo;s pretended objection to the 
Darwinism of his time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give our philosopher,&rdquo; he says, 
&ldquo;appetencies; give him a portion of living irritable matter
(a nerve or the clipping of a nerve) to work upon; give also to 
his incipient or progressive forms the power of propagating their
like in every stage of their alteration; and if he is to be 
believed, he could replenish the world with all the vegetable and
animal productions which we now see in it.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148" 
class="citation">[148]</a></p>
<p>After meeting this theory with answers which need not detain 
us, he continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The senses of animals appear to me quite incapable of 
receiving the explanation of their origin which this theory 
affords.&nbsp; Including under the word &lsquo;sense&rsquo; the 
organ and the perception, we have no account of either.&nbsp; How
will our philosopher get at vision or make an eye?&nbsp; Or, 
suppose the eye formed, would the perception <!-- page 149--><a 
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
149</span>follow?&nbsp; The same of the other senses.&nbsp; And 
this objection holds its force, ascribe what you will to the hand
of time, to the power of habit, to changes too slow to be 
observed by man, or brought within any comparison which he is 
able to make of past things with the present.&nbsp; Concede what 
you please to these arbitrary and unattested superstitions, how 
will they help you?&nbsp; Here is no inception.&nbsp; No laws, no
course, no powers of nature which prevail at present, nor any 
analogous to these would give commencement to a new sense; and it
is in vain to inquire how that might proceed which would never 
<i>begin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to this, let us suppose that some inhabitants of 
another world were to see a modern philosopher so using a 
microscope that they should believe it to be a part of the 
philosopher&rsquo;s own person, which he could cut off from and 
join again to himself at pleasure, and suppose there were a 
controversy as to how this microscope had originated, and that 
one party maintained the man had made it little by little because
he wanted it, while the other declared this to be absurd and 
impossible; I ask, would this latter party be justified in 
arguing that microscopes could never have been perfected by 
degrees through the preservation of and accumulation of small 
successive improvements inasmuch as men could not have begun to 
want to use microscopes until they had had a microscope which 
should show them that such an instrument would be useful to them,
and that hence there is nothing to account for the 
<i>beginning</i> of microscopes, which might indeed make some 
progress when once originated, but which could never 
originate?</p>
<p>It might be pointed out to such a reasoner, firstly, that as 
regards any acquired power the various stages <!-- page 150--><a 
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>in the 
acquisition of which he might be supposed able to remember, he 
would find that logic notwithstanding, the wish did originate the
power, and yet was originated by it, both coming up gradually out
of something which was not recognisable as either power or wish, 
and advancing through vain beating of the air, to a vague effort,
and from this to definite effort with failure, and from this to 
definite effort with success, and from this to success with 
little consciousness of effort, and from this to success with 
such complete absence of effort that he now acts unconsciously 
and without power of introspection, and that, do what he will, he
can rarely or never draw a sharp dividing line whereat anything 
shall be said to begin, though none less certain that there has 
been a continuity in discontinuity, and a discontinuity in 
continuity between it and certain other past things; moreover, 
that his opponents postulated so much beginning of the microscope
as that there should be a dew-drop, even as our evolutionists 
start with a sense of touch, of which sense all the others are 
modifications, so that not one of them, but is resolvable into 
touch by more or less easy stages; and secondly, that the 
question is one of fact and of the more evident deductions 
therefrom, and should not be carried back to those remote 
beginnings where the nature of the facts is so purely a matter of
conjecture and inference.</p>
<p>No plant or animal, then, according to our view, would be able
to conceive more than a very slight improvement on its 
organisation at a given time, so clearly as to make the efforts 
towards it that would result in growth of the required 
modification; nor would these efforts be made with any 
far-sighted perception of what next and next and after, but only 
of what next; while many of the happiest thoughts would come like
all other <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>happy thoughts&mdash;thoughtlessly; 
by a chain of reasoning too swift and subtle for conscious 
analysis by the individual.&nbsp; Some of these modifications 
would be noticeable, but the majority would involve no more 
noticeable difference that can be detected between the length of 
the shortest day, and that of the shortest but one.</p>
<p>Thus a bird whose toes were not webbed, but who had under 
force of circumstances little by little in the course of many 
generations learned to swim, either from having lived near a 
lake, and having learnt the art owing to its fishing habits, or 
from wading about in shallow pools by the sea-side at low water 
and finding itself sometimes a little out of its depth and just 
managing to scramble over the intermediate yard or so between it 
and safety&mdash;such a bird did not probably conceive the idea 
of swimming on the water and set itself to learn to do so, and 
then conceive the idea of webbed feet and set itself to get 
webbed feet.&nbsp; The bird found itself in some small 
difficulty, out of which it either saw, or at any rate found that
it could extricate itself by striking out vigorously with its 
feet and extending its toes as far as ever it could; it thus 
began to learn the art of swimming and conceived the idea of 
swimming synchronously, or nearly so; or perhaps wishing to get 
over a yard or two of deep water, and trying to do so without 
being at the trouble of rising to fly, it would splash and 
struggle its way over the water, and thus practically swim, 
though without much perception of what it had been doing.&nbsp; 
Finding that no harm had come to it, the bird would do the same 
again and again; it would thus presently lose fear, and would be 
able to act more calmly; then it would begin to find out that it 
could swim a little, and <!-- page 152--><a 
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>if its food
lay much in the water so that it would be of great advantage to 
it to be able to alight and rest without being forced to return 
to land, it would begin to make a practice of swimming.&nbsp; It 
would now discover that it could swim the more easily according 
as its feet presented a more extended surface to the water; it 
would therefore keep its toes extended wherever it swam, and as 
far as in it lay, would make the most of whatever skin was 
already at the base of its toes.&nbsp; After many generations it 
would become web-footed, if doing as above described should have 
been found continuously convenient, so that the bird should have 
continuously used the skin about its toes as much as possible in 
this direction.</p>
<p>For there is a margin in every organic structure (and perhaps 
more than we imagine in things inorganic also), which will admit 
of references, as it were, side notes, and glosses upon the 
original text.&nbsp; It is on this margin that we may err or 
wander&mdash;the greatness of a mistake depending rather upon the
extent of the departure from the original text, than on the 
direction that the departure takes.&nbsp; A little error on the 
bad side is more pardonable, and less likely to hurt the organism
than a too great departure upon the right one.&nbsp; This is a 
fundamental proposition in any true system of ethics, the 
question what is too much or too sudden being decided by much the
same higgling as settles the price of butter in a country market,
and being as invisible as the link which connects the last moment
of desire with the first of power and performance, and with the 
material result achieved.</p>
<p>It is on this margin that the fulcrum is to be found, whereby 
we obtain the little purchase over our structure, that enables us
to achieve great results if we use <!-- page 153--><a 
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>it 
steadily, with judgment, and with neither too little effort nor 
too much.&nbsp; It is by employing this that those who have a 
fancy to move their ears or toes without moving other organs 
learn to do so.&nbsp; There is a man at the Agricultural Hall now
<a name="citation153a"></a><a href="#footnote153a" 
class="citation">[153a]</a> playing the violin with his toes, and
playing it, as I am told, sufficiently well.&nbsp; The eye of the
sailor, the wrist of the conjuror, the toe of the professional 
medium, are all found capable of development to an astonishing 
degree, even in a single lifetime; but in every case success has 
been attained by the simple process of making the best of 
whatever power a man has had at any given time, and by being on 
the look-out to take advantage of accident, and even of 
misfortune.&nbsp; If a man would learn to paint, he must not 
theorise concerning art, nor think much what he would do 
beforehand, but he must do <i>something</i>&mdash;whatever under 
the circumstances will come handiest and easiest to him; and he 
must do that something as well as he can.&nbsp; This will 
presently open the door for something else, and a way will show 
itself which no conceivable amount of searching would have 
discovered, but which yet could never have been discovered by 
sitting still and taking no pains at all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dans 
l&rsquo;animal,&rdquo; says Buffon, &ldquo;il y a moins de 
jugement que de sentiment.&rdquo; <a name="citation153b"></a><a 
href="#footnote153b" class="citation">[153b]</a></p>
<p>It may appear as though this were blowing hot and cold with 
the same breath, inasmuch as I am insisting that important 
modifications of structure have been always purposive; and at the
same time am denying that the creature modified has had any 
far-seeing purpose in the greater part of all those actions which
have at length modified both structure and instinct.&nbsp; Thus I
say that a bird learns to swim without having <!-- page 154--><a 
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>any purpose
of learning to swim before it set itself to make those movements 
which have resulted in its being able to do so.&nbsp; At the same
time I maintain that it has only learned to swim by trying to 
swim, and this involves the very purpose which I have just 
denied.&nbsp; The reconciliation of these two apparently 
irreconcilable contentions must be found in the consideration 
that the bird was not the less trying to swim, merely because it 
did not know the name we have chosen to give to the art which it 
was trying to master, nor yet how great were the resources of 
that art.&nbsp; A person, who knew all about swimming, if from 
some bank he could watch our supposed bird&rsquo;s first attempt 
to scramble over a short space of deep water, would at once 
declare that the bird was trying to swim&mdash;if not actually 
swimming.&nbsp; Provided then that there is a very little 
perception of, and prescience concerning, the means whereby the 
next desired end may be attained, it matters not how little in 
advance that end may be of present desire or faculties; it is 
still reached through purpose, and must be called 
purposive.&nbsp; Again, no matter how many of these small steps 
be taken, nor how absolute was the want of purpose or prescience 
concerning any but the one being actually taken at any given 
moment, this does not bar the result from having been arrived at 
through design and purpose.&nbsp; If each one of the small steps 
is purposive the result is purposive, though there was never 
purpose extended over more than one, two, or perhaps at most 
three steps at a time.</p>
<p>Returning to the art of painting for an example, are we to say
that the proficiency which such a student as was supposed above 
will certainly attain, is not due to design, merely because it 
was not until he had already <!-- page 155--><a 
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>become 
three parts excellent that he knew the full purport of all that 
he had been doing?&nbsp; When he began he had but vague notions 
of what he would do.&nbsp; He had a wish to learn to represent 
nature, but the line into which he has settled down has probably 
proved very different from that which he proposed to himself 
originally.&nbsp; Because he has taken advantage of his 
accidents, is it, therefore, one whit the less true that his 
success is the result of his desires and his design?&nbsp; The 
<i>Times</i> pointed out some time ago that the theory which now 
associates meteors and comets in the most unmistakable manner, 
was suggested by one accident, and confirmed by another.&nbsp; 
But the writer added well that &ldquo;such accidents happen only 
to the zealous student of nature&rsquo;s secrets.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
the same way the bird that is taking to the habit of swimming, 
and of making the most of whatever skin it already has between 
its toes, will have doubtless to thank accidents for no small 
part of its progress; but they will be such accidents as could 
never have happened to or been taken advantage of by any creature
which was not zealously trying to make the most of 
itself&mdash;and between such accidents as this, and design, the 
line is hard to draw; for if we go deep enough we shall find that
most of our design resolves itself into as it were a shaking of 
the bag to see what will come out that will suit our purpose, and
yet at the same time that most of our shaking of the bag resolves
itself into a design that the bag shall contain only such and 
such things, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>Again, the fact that animals are no longer conscious of design
and purpose in much that they do, but act unreflectingly, and as 
we sometimes say concerning ourselves &ldquo;automatically&rdquo;
or &ldquo;mechanically&rdquo;&mdash;that they have no idea 
whatever of the steps, whereby they <!-- page 156--><a 
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>have 
travelled to their present state, and show no sign of doubt about
what must have been at one time the subject of all manner of 
doubts, difficulties, and discussions&mdash;that whatever sign of
reflection they now exhibit is to be found only in case of some 
novel feature or difficulty presenting itself; these facts do not
bar that the results achieved should be attributed to an 
inception in reason, design and purpose, no matter how rapidly 
and as we call it instinctively, the creatures may now act.</p>
<p>For if we look closely at such an invention as the steam 
engine in its latest and most complicated developments, about 
which there can be no dispute but that they are achievements of 
reason, purpose and design, we shall find them present us with 
examples of all those features the presence of which in the 
handiwork of animals is too often held to bar reason and purpose 
from having had any share therein.</p>
<p>Assuredly such men as the Marquis of Worcester and Captain 
Savery had very imperfect ideas as to the upshot of their own 
action.&nbsp; The simplest steam engine now in use in England is 
probably a marvel of ingenuity as compared with the highest 
development which appeared possible to these two great men, while
our newest and most highly complicated engines would seem to them
more like living beings than machines.&nbsp; Many, again, of the 
steps leading to the present development have been due to action 
which had but little heed of the steam engine, being the 
inventions of attendants whose desire was to save themselves the 
trouble of turning this or that cock, and who were indifferent to
any other end than their own immediate convenience.&nbsp; No step
in fact along the whole route was ever taken with much perception
of what would <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>be the next step after the one being
taken at any given moment.</p>
<p>Nor do we find that an engine made after any old and 
well-known pattern is now made with much more consciousness of 
design than we can suppose a bird&rsquo;s nest to be built 
with.&nbsp; The greater number of the parts of any such engine, 
are made by the gross as it were like screw and nuts, which are 
turned out by machinery and in respect of which the labour of 
design is now no more felt than is the design of him who first 
invented the wheel.&nbsp; It is only when circumstances require 
any modification in the article to be manufactured that thought 
and design will come into play again; but I take it few will deny
that if circumstances compel a bird either to give up a nest 
three-parts built altogether, or to make some trifling deviation 
from its ordinary practice, it will in nine cases out of ten make
such deviation as shall show that it had thought the matter over,
and had on the whole concluded to take such and such a course, 
that is to say, that it had reasoned and had acted with such 
purpose as its reason had dictated.</p>
<p>And I imagine that this is the utmost that any one can claim 
even for man&rsquo;s own boasted powers.&nbsp; Set the man who 
has been accustomed to make engines of one type, to make engines 
of another type without any intermediate course of training or 
instruction, and he will make no better figure with his engines 
than a thrush would do if commanded by her mate to make a nest 
like a blackbird.&nbsp; It is vain then to contend that the ease 
and certainty with which an action is performed, even though it 
may have now become matter of such fixed habit that it cannot be 
suddenly and seriously modified without rendering the whole 
performance abortive, is any argument against that <!-- page 
158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
158</span>action having been an achievement of design and reason 
in respect of each one of the steps that have led to it; and if 
in respect of each one of the steps then as regards the entire 
action; for we see our own most reasoned actions become no less 
easy, unerring, automatic, and unconscious, than the actions 
which we call instinctive when they have been repeated a 
sufficient number of times.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>If the foregoing be granted, and it be admitted that the 
unconsciousness and seeming automatism with which any action may 
be performed is no bar to its having a foundation in memory, 
reason, and at one time consciously recognised effort&mdash;and 
this I believe to be the chief addition which I have ventured to 
make to the theory of Buffon and Dr. Erasmus Darwin&mdash;then 
the wideness of the difference between the Darwinism of eighty 
years ago and the Darwinism of to-day becomes immediately 
apparent, and it also becomes apparent, how important and 
interesting is the issue which is raised between them.</p>
<p>According to the older Darwinism the lungs are just as 
purposive as the corkscrew.&nbsp; They, no less than the 
corkscrew, are a piece of mechanism designed and gradually 
improved upon and perfected by an intelligent creature for the 
gratification of its own needs.&nbsp; True there are many 
important differences between mechanism which is part of the 
body, and mechanism which is no such part, but the differences 
are such as do not affect the fact that in each case the result, 
whether, for example, lungs or corkscrew, is due to desire, 
invention, and design.</p>
<p>And now I will ask one more question, which may seem, perhaps,
to have but little importance, but which <!-- page 159--><a 
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>I find 
personally interesting.&nbsp; I have been told by a reviewer, of 
whom upon the whole I have little reason to complain, that the 
theory I put forward in &ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; and which I
am now again insisting on, is pessimism&mdash;pure and 
simple.&nbsp; I have a very vague idea what pessimism means, but 
I should be sorry to believe that I am a pessimist.&nbsp; Which, 
I would ask, is the pessimist?&nbsp; He who sees love of beauty, 
design, steadfastness of purpose, intelligence, courage, and 
every quality to which success has assigned the name of 
&ldquo;worth&rdquo; as having drawn the pattern of every leaf and
organ now and in all past time, or he who sees nothing in the 
world of nature but a chapter of accidents and of forces 
interacting blindly?</p>
<h3><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>BUFFON&mdash;MEMOIR.&nbsp; (<span 
class="smcap">chapter viii. of evolution</span>, <span 
class="smcap">old and new</span>.)</h3>
<p>Buffon, says M. Flourens, was born at Montbar, on the 7th of 
September 1707; he died in Paris, at the Jardin du Roi, on the 
16th of April 1788, aged 81 years.&nbsp; More than fifty of these
years, as he used himself to say, he had passed at his 
writing-desk.&nbsp; His father was a councillor of the parliament
of Burgundy.&nbsp; His mother was celebrated for her wit, and 
Buffon cherished her memory.</p>
<p>He studied at Dijon with much <i>&eacute;clat</i>, and shortly
after leaving became accidentally acquainted with the Duke of 
Kingston, a young Englishman of his own age, who was travelling 
abroad with a tutor.&nbsp; The three travelled together in France
and Italy, and Buffon then passed some months in England.</p>
<p>Returning to France, he translated Hales&rsquo;s Vegetable 
Statics and Newton&rsquo;s Treatise on Fluxions.&nbsp; He refers 
to several English writers on natural history in the course of 
his work, but I see he repeated spells the English name 
Willoughby, &ldquo;Willulghby.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was appointed 
superintendent of the Jardin du Roi in 1739, and from thenceforth
devoted himself to science.</p>
<p>In 1752 Buffon married Mdlle de Saint B&eacute;lin, whose 
beauty and charm of manner were extolled by all her 
contemporaries.&nbsp; One son was born to him, who entered the 
army, became a colonel, and I grieve to say, was <!-- page 
161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
161</span>guillotined at the age of twenty-nine, a few days only 
before the extinction of the Reign of Terror.</p>
<p>Of this youth, who inherited the personal comeliness and 
ability of his father, little is recorded except the following 
story.&nbsp; Having fallen into the water and been nearly drowned
when he was about twelve years old, he was afterwards accused of 
having been afraid: &ldquo;I was so little afraid,&rdquo; he 
answered, &ldquo;that though I had been offered the hundred years
which my grandfather lived, I would have died then and there, if 
I could have added one year to the life of my father;&rdquo; then
thinking for a minute, a flush suffused his face and he added, 
&ldquo;but I should petition for one quarter of an hour in which 
to exult over the thought of what I was about to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the scaffold he showed much composure, smiling half 
proudly, half reproachfully, yet wholly kindly upon the crowd in 
front of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Citoyens,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Je me
nomine Buffon,&rdquo; and laid his head upon the block.</p>
<p>The noblest outcome of the old and decaying order, overwhelmed
in the most hateful birth frenzy of the new.&nbsp; So in those 
cataclysms and revolutions which take place in our own bodies 
during their development, when we seem studying in order to 
become fishes and suddenly make, as it were, different 
arrangements and resolve on becoming men&mdash;so, doubtless, 
many good cells must go, and their united death cry comes up, it 
may be, in the pain which an infant feels on teething.&nbsp; But 
to return.&nbsp; The man who could be father of such a son, and 
who could retain that son&rsquo;s affection, as it is well known 
that Buffon retained it, may not perhaps always be strictly 
accurate, but it will be as well to pay attention to whatever he 
may think fit to <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>tell us.&nbsp; These are the only 
people whom it is worth while to look to and study from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; said Buffon, after speaking of the hours 
during which he had laboured, &ldquo;glory comes always after 
labour if she can&mdash;<i>and she generally 
can</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in his case she could not well help 
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was conspicuous,&rdquo; says M. 
Flourens, &ldquo;for elevation and force of character, for a love
of greatness and true magnificence in all he did.&nbsp; His great
wealth, his handsome person, and graceful manners seemed in 
correspondence with the splendour of his genius, so that of all 
the gifts which Fortune has in it her power to bestow she had 
denied him nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of his epigrammatic sayings have passed into proverbs: 
for example, that &ldquo;genius is but a supreme capacity for 
taking pains.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another and still more celebrated 
passage shall be given in its entirety and with its original 
setting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Style,&rdquo; says Buffon, &ldquo;is the only passport 
to posterity.&nbsp; It is not range of information, nor mastery 
of some little known branch of science, nor yet novelty of matter
that will ensure immortality.&nbsp; Works that can claim all this
will yet die if they are conversant about trivial objects only, 
or written without taste, genius, and true nobility of mind; for 
range of information, knowledge of details, novelty of discovery 
are of a volatile essence and fly off readily into other hands 
that know better how to treat them.&nbsp; The matter is foreign 
to the man, and is not of him; the manner is the man 
himself.&rdquo; <a name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162" 
class="citation">[162]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Le style, c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;homme 
m&ecirc;mo.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elsewhere he tells us what true style 
is, but I quote from memory and cannot be sure of the 
passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Le style,&rdquo; he says <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>&ldquo;est 
comme le bonheur; il vient de la douceur de 
l&rsquo;&acirc;me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is it possible not to think of the following?&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whether there be prophecies they shall fail; 
whether there be tongues they shall cease; whether there be 
knowledge it shall vanish away . . . and now abideth faith, hope 
and charity, these three; but the greatest of these is 
charity.&rdquo; <a name="citation163"></a><a href="#footnote163" 
class="citation">[163]</a></p>
<h3><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span

IRONICAL CHARACTER OF HIS WORK.&nbsp; (<span 
class="smcap">chapter ix. of evolution</span>, <span 
class="smcap">old and new</span>.)</h3>
<p>Buffon&rsquo;s idea of a method amounts almost to the denial 
of the possibility of method at all.&nbsp; &ldquo;The true 
method,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;is the complete description and 
exact history of each particular object,&rdquo; <a 
name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a" 
class="citation">[164a]</a> and later on he asks, &ldquo;is it 
not more simple, more natural and more true to call an ass an 
ass, and a cat a cat, than to say, without knowing why, that an 
ass is a horse, and a cat a lynx?&rdquo; <a 
name="citation164b"></a><a href="#footnote164b" 
class="citation">[164b]</a></p>
<p>He admits such divisions as between animals and vegetables, or
between vegetables and minerals, but that done, he rejects all 
others that can be founded on the nature of things 
themselves.&nbsp; He concludes that one who could see living 
forms as a whole and without preconceived opinions, would 
classify animals according to the relations in which he found 
himself standing towards them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those which he finds most necessary and 
useful to him will occupy the first rank; thus he will give the 
precedence among the lower animals to the dog and the horse; he 
will next concern himself with those which without being 
domesticated, nevertheless occupy the same country and climate as
himself, as for example <!-- page 165--><a 
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>stags, 
hares, and all wild animals; nor will it be till after he has 
familiarised himself with all these that curiosity will lead him 
to inquire what inhabitants there may be in foreign climates, 
such as elephants, dromedaries, &amp;c.&nbsp; The same will hold 
good for fishes, birds, insects, shells, and for all 
nature&rsquo;s other productions; he will study them in 
proportion to the profit which he can draw from them; he will 
consider them in that order in which they enter into his daily 
life; he will arrange them in his head according to this order, 
which is in fact that in which he has become acquainted with 
them, and in which it concerns him to think about them, This 
order&mdash;the most natural of all&mdash;is the one which I have
thought it well to follow in this volume.&nbsp; My classification
has no more mystery in it than the reader has just seen . . . it 
is preferable to the most profound and ingenious that can be 
conceived, for there is none of all the classifications which 
ever have been made or ever can be, which has not more of an 
arbitrary character than this has.&nbsp; Take it for all in 
all,&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;it is more easy, more agreeable,
and more useful, to consider things in their relation to 
ourselves than from any other standpoint.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165" 
class="citation">[165]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it not a better effect not only in a treatise on 
natural history, but in a picture or any work of art to arrange 
objects in the order and place in which they are commonly found, 
than to force them into association in virtue of some theory of 
our own?&nbsp; Is it not better to let the dog which has toes, 
come after the horse which has a single hoof, in the same way as 
we see him follow the horse in daily life, than to follow up the 
horse by the zebra, an animal which is little known to us, and 
<!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
166</span>which has no other connection with the horse than the 
fact that it has a single hoof?&rdquo; <a 
name="citation166a"></a><a href="#footnote166a" 
class="citation">[166a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can we suppose that Buffon really saw no more connection than 
this?&nbsp; The writer whom we shall presently find <a 
name="citation166b"></a><a href="#footnote166b" 
class="citation">[166b]</a> declining to admit any essential 
difference between the skeletons of man and of the horse, can 
here see no resemblance between the zebra and the horse, except 
that they each have a single hoof.&nbsp; Is he to be taken at his
word?</p>
<p>It is perhaps necessary to tell the reader that Buffon carried
the foregoing scheme into practice as nearly as he could in the 
first fifteen volumes of his Natural History.&nbsp; He begins 
with man&mdash;and then goes on to the horse, the ass, the cow, 
sheep, goat, pig, dog, &amp;c.&nbsp; One would be glad to know 
whether he found it always more easy to know in what order of 
familiarity this or that animal would stand to the majority of 
his readers than other classifiers have found it to know whether 
an individual more resembles one species or another; probably he 
never gave the matter a thought after he had gone through the 
first dozen most familiar animals, but settled generally down 
into a classification which becomes more and more 
specific&mdash;as when he treats of the apes and 
monkeys&mdash;till he reaches the birds, when he openly abandons 
his original idea, in deference, as he says, to the opinion of 
&ldquo;le peuple des naturalistes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the key to this piece of apparent extravagance is to 
be found in the word &ldquo;myst&eacute;rieuse.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation166c"></a><a href="#footnote166c" 
class="citation">[166c]</a>&nbsp; Buffon wished to raise a 
standing protest against mystery mongering.&nbsp; Or perhaps more
probably, he wished at once to turn to animals under 
domestication, so as to insist early on the main object of his 
work&mdash;the plasticity of animal forms.</p>
<p><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>I am inclined to think that a vein of irony pervades 
the whole or much the greater part of Buffon&rsquo;s work, and 
that he intended to convey one meaning to one set of readers, and
another to another; indeed, it is often impossible to believe 
that he is not writing between his lines for the discerning, what
the undiscerning were not intended to see.&nbsp; It must be 
remembered that his Natural History has two sides,&mdash;a 
scientific and a popular one.&nbsp; May we not imagine that 
Buffon would be unwilling to debar himself from speaking to those
who could understand him, and yet would wish like Handel and 
Shakespeare to address the many, as well as the few?&nbsp; But 
the only manner in which these seemingly irreconcilable ends 
could be attained, would be by the use of language which should 
be self-adjusting to the capacity of the reader.&nbsp; So keen an
observer can hardly have been blind to the signs of the times 
which were already close at hand.&nbsp; Free-thinker though he 
was, he was also a powerful member of the aristocracy, and little
likely to demean himself&mdash;for so he would doubtless hold 
it&mdash;by playing the part of Voltaire or Rousseau.&nbsp; He 
would help those who could see to see still further, but he would
not dazzle eyes that were yet imperfect with a light brighter 
than they could stand.&nbsp; He would therefore impose upon 
people, as much as he thought was for their good; but, on the 
other hand, he would not allow inferior men to mystify them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the private character of Buffon,&rdquo; says Sir 
William Jardine in a characteristic passage, &ldquo;we regret 
there is not much to praise; his disposition was kind and 
benevolent, and he was generally beloved by his inferiors, 
followers, and dependants, which were numerous over his extensive
property; he was strictly honourable, <!-- page 168--><a 
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>and was an 
affectionate parent.&nbsp; In early youth he had entered into the
pleasures and dissipations of life, and licentious habits seem to
have been retained to the end.&nbsp; But the great blemish in 
such a mind was his declared infidelity; it presents one of those
exceptions among the persons who have been devoted to the study 
of nature; and it is not easy to imagine a mind apparently with 
such powers, scarcely acknowledging a Creator, and when noticed, 
only by an arraignment for what appeared wanting or defective in 
His great works.&nbsp; So openly, indeed, was the freedom of his 
religious opinions expressed, that the indignation of the 
Sorbonne was provoked.&nbsp; He had to enter into an explanation 
which he in some way rendered satisfactory; and while he 
afterwards attended to the outward ordinances of religion, he 
considered them as a system of faith for the multitude, and 
regarded those most impolitic who most opposed them.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168" 
class="citation">[168]</a></p>
<p>This is partly correct and partly not.&nbsp; Buffon was a 
free-thinker, and as I have sufficiently explained, a decided 
opponent of the doctrine that rudimentary and therefore useless 
organs were designed by a Creator in order to serve some useful 
end throughout all time to the creature in which they are 
found.</p>
<p>He was not, surely, to hide the magnificent conceptions which 
he had been the first to grasp, from those who were worthy to 
receive them; on the other hand he would not tell the 
uninstructed what they would interpret as a licence to do 
whatever they pleased, inasmuch as there was no God.&nbsp; What 
he did was to point so irresistibly in the right direction, that 
a reader of any intelligence should be in no doubt as to the road
he ought to take, and then to contradict himself <!-- page 
169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>so
flatly as to reassure those who would be shocked by a truth for 
which they were not yet ready.&nbsp; If I am right in the view 
which I have taken of Buffon&rsquo;s work, it is not easy to see 
how he could have formed a finer scheme, nor have carried it out 
more finely.</p>
<p>I should, however, warn the reader to be on his guard against 
accepting my view too hastily.&nbsp; So far as I know I stand 
alone in taking it.&nbsp; Neither Dr. Darwin, nor Flourens, nor 
Isidore Geoffroy, nor Mr. Charles Darwin see any subrisive humour
in Buffon&rsquo;s pages; but it must be remembered that Flourens 
was a strong opponent of mutability, and probably paid but little
heed to what Buffon said on this question; Isidore Geoffroy is 
not a safe guide, few men indeed less so.&nbsp; Mr. Charles 
Darwin seems to have adopted the one half of Isidore 
Geoffrey&rsquo;s conclusions without verifying either; and Dr. 
Erasmus Darwin, who has no small share of a very pleasant 
conscious humour, yet sometimes rises to such heights of 
unconscious humour, that Buffon&rsquo;s puny labour may well have
been invisible to him.&nbsp; Dr. Darwin wrote a great deal of 
poetry, some of which was about the common pump.&nbsp; Miss 
Seward tells us, that he &ldquo;illustrated this familiar object 
with a picture of Maternal Beauty administering sustenance to her
infant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Buffon could not have done anything like 
this.</p>
<p>Buffon never, then, &ldquo;arraigned the Creator for what was 
wanting or defective in His works;&rdquo; on the contrary, 
whenever he was led up by an irresistible chain of reasoning to 
conclusions which should make men recast their ideas concerning 
the Deity, he invariably retreats under cover of an appeal to 
revelation.&nbsp; Naturally enough, the Sorbonne objected to an 
artifice which even Buffon could not conceal completely.&nbsp; 
They did <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>not like being undermined; like 
Buffon himself, they preferred imposing upon the people, to 
seeing others do so.&nbsp; Buffon made his peace with the 
Sorbonne immediately, and, perhaps, from that time forward, 
contradicted himself a little more impudently than 
heretofore.</p>
<p>It is probably for the reasons above suggested that Buffon did
not propound a connected scheme of evolution or descent with 
modification, but scattered his theory in fragments up and down 
his work in the prefatory remarks with which he introduces the 
more striking animals or classes of animals.&nbsp; He never 
wastes evolutionary matter in the preface to an uninteresting 
animal; and the more interesting the animal, the more evolution 
will there be commonly found.&nbsp; When he comes to describe the
animal more familiarly&mdash;and he generally begins a fresh 
chapter or half chapter when he does so&mdash;he writes no more 
about evolution, but gives an admirable description, which no one
can fail to enjoy, and which I cannot think is nearly so 
inaccurate as is commonly supposed.&nbsp; These descriptions are 
the parts which Buffon intended for the general reader, 
expecting, doubtless, and desiring that such a reader should skip
the dry parts he had been addressing to the more studious.&nbsp; 
It is true the descriptions are written <i>ad captandum</i>, as 
are all great works, but they succeed in captivating, having been
composed with all the pains a man of genius and of great 
perseverance could bestow upon them.&nbsp; If I am not mistaken, 
he looked to these parts of his work to keep the whole alive till
the time should come when the philosophical side of his writings 
should be understood and appreciated.</p>
<p>Thus the goat breeds with the sheep, and may therefore <!-- 
page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
171</span>serve as the text for a dissertation on hybridism, 
which is accordingly given in the preface to this animal.&nbsp; 
The presence of rudimentary organs under a pig&rsquo;s hoof 
suggests an attack upon the doctrine of final causes in so far as
it is pretended that every part of every animal or plant was 
specially designed with a view to the wants of the animal or 
plant itself, once and forever throughout all time.&nbsp; The dog
with his great variety of breeds gives an opportunity for an 
article on the formation of breeds and sub-breeds by man&rsquo;s 
artificial selection.&nbsp; The cat is not honoured with any 
philosophical reflection, and comes in for nothing but 
abuse.&nbsp; The hare suggests the rabbit, and the rabbit is a 
rapid breeder, although the hare is an unusually slow one; but 
this is near enough, so the hare shall serve us for the theme of 
a discourse on the geometrical ratio of increase and the balance 
of power which may be observed in nature.&nbsp; When we come to 
the carnivora, additional reflections follow upon the necessity 
for death, and even for violent death; this leads to the question
whether the creatures that are killed suffer pain; here, then, 
will be the proper place for considering the sensations of 
animals generally.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most pregnant passage concerning evolution is to 
be found in the preface to the ass, which is so near the 
beginning of the work as to be only the second animal of which 
Buffon treats after having described man himself.&nbsp; It points
strongly in the direction of his having believed all animal forms
to have been descended from one single common ancestral 
type.&nbsp; Buffon did not probably choose to take his very first
opportunity in order to insist upon matter that should point in 
this direction; but the considerations <!-- page 172--><a 
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>were too 
important to be deferred long, and are accordingly put forward 
under cover of the ass, his second animal.</p>
<p>When we consider the force with which Buffon&rsquo;s 
conclusion is led up to; the obviousness of the conclusion itself
when the premises are once admitted; the impossibility that such 
a conclusion should be again lost sight of if the reasonableness 
of its being drawn had been once admitted; the position in his 
scheme which is assigned to it by its propounder; the persistency
with which he demonstrates during forty years thereafter that the
premises, which he has declared should establish the conclusion 
in question, are indisputable;&mdash;when we consider, too, that 
we are dealing with a man of unquestionable genius, and that the 
times and circumstances of his life were such as would go far to 
explain reserve and irony&mdash;is it, I would ask, reasonable to
suppose that Buffon did not in his own mind, and from the first, 
draw the inference to which he leads his reader, merely because 
from time to time he tells the reader, with a shrug of the 
shoulders, that <i>he</i> draws no inferences opposed to the Book
of Genesis?&nbsp; Is it not more likely that Buffon intended his 
reader to draw his inferences for himself, and perhaps to value 
them all the more highly on that account?</p>
<p>The passage to which I am alluding is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If from the boundless variety which 
animated nature presents to us, we choose the body of some animal
or even that of man himself to serve as a model with which to 
compare the bodies of other organised beings, we shall find that 
though all these beings have an individuality of their own, and 
are distinguished from one another by differences of which the 
gradations are infinitely subtle, there exists at the same time a
<!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
173</span>primitive and general design which we can follow for a 
long way, and the departures from which 
(<i>d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;rations</i>) are far more gentle 
than those from mere outward resemblance.&nbsp; For not to 
mention organs of digestion, circulation, and generation, which 
are common to all animals, and without which the animal would 
cease to be an animal, and could neither continue to exist nor 
reproduce itself&mdash;there is none the less even in those very 
parts which constitute the main difference in outward appearance,
a striking resemblance which carries with it irresistibly the 
idea of a single pattern after which all would appear to have 
been conceived.&nbsp; The horse, for example&mdash;what can at 
first sight seem more unlike mankind?&nbsp; Yet when we compare 
man and horse point by point and detail by detail, is not our 
wonder excited rather by the points of resemblance than of 
difference that are to be found between them?&nbsp; Take the 
skeleton of a man; bend forward the bones in the region of the 
pelvis, shorten the thigh bones, and those of the leg and arm, 
lengthen those of the feet and hands, run the joints together, 
lengthen the jaws, and shorten the frontal bone, finally, 
lengthen the spine, and the skeleton will now be that of a man no
longer, but will have become that of a horse&mdash;for it is easy
to imagine that in lengthening the spine and the jaws we shall at
the same time have increased the number of the vertebr&aelig;, 
ribs, and teeth.&nbsp; It is but in the number of these bones, 
which may be considered accessory, and by the lengthening, 
shortening, or mode of attachment of others, that the skeleton of
the horse differs from that of the human body. . . . We find ribs
in man, in all the quadrupeds, in birds, in fishes, and we may 
find traces of them as far down as the turtle, in which they seem
still to be sketched <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>out by means of furrows that are to 
be found beneath the shell.&nbsp; Let it be remembered that the 
foot of the horse, which seems so different from a man&rsquo;s 
hand, is, nevertheless, as M. Daubenton has pointed out, composed
of the same bones, and that we have at the end of each of our 
fingers a nail corresponding to the hoof of a horse&rsquo;s 
foot.&nbsp; Judge, then, whether this hidden resemblance is not 
more marvellous than any outward differences&mdash;whether this 
constancy to a single plan of structure which we may follow from 
man to the quadrupeds, from the quadrupeds to the cetacea, from 
the cetacea to birds, from birds to reptiles, from reptiles to 
fishes&mdash;in which all such essential parts as heart, 
intestines, spine are invariably found&mdash;whether, I say, this
does not seem to indicate that the Creator when He made them 
would use but a single main idea, though at the same time varying
it in every conceivable way, so that man might admire equally the
magnificence of the execution and the simplicity of the 
design.&rdquo; <a name="citation174"></a><a href="#footnote174" 
class="citation">[174]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;If we regard the matter thus, not only the ass and the 
horse, <i>but even man himself</i>, <i>the apes</i>, <i>the 
quadrupeds</i>, <i>and all animals might be regarded but as 
forming members of one and the same family</i>.&nbsp; But are we 
to conclude that within this vast family which the Creator has 
called into existence out of nothing, there are other and smaller
families, projected as it were by Nature, and brought forth by 
her in the natural course of events and after a long time, of 
which some contain but two members, as the ass and the horse, 
others many members, as the weasel, martin, stoat, ferret, 
&amp;c., and that on the same principle there are families of 
vegetables, containing ten, twenty, or thirty plants, as the case
may be?&nbsp; If such families had any real existence <!-- page 
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
175</span>they could have been formed only by crossing, by the 
accumulation of successive variations (<i>variation 
successive</i>), and by degeneration from an original type; but 
if we once admit that there are families of plants and animals, 
so that the ass may be of the family of the horse, and that the 
one may only differ from the other through degeneration from a 
common ancestor, we might be driven to admit that the ape is of 
the family of man, that he is but a degenerate man, and that he 
and man have had a common ancestor, even as the ass and horse 
have had.&nbsp; It would follow then that every family, whether 
animal or vegetable, had sprung from a single stock, which after 
a succession of generations had become higher in the case of some
of its descendants and lower in that of others.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What inference could be more aptly drawn?&nbsp; But it was not
one which Buffon was going to put before the general 
public.&nbsp; He had said enough for the discerning, and 
continues with what is intended to make the conclusions they 
should draw even plainer to them, while it conceals them still 
more carefully from the general reader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The naturalists who are so ready to establish families 
among animals and vegetables, do not seem to have sufficiently 
considered the consequences which should follow from their 
premises, for these would limit direct creation to as small a 
number of forms as any one might think fit (reduisoient le 
produit imm&eacute;diat de la cr&eacute;ation, &agrave;un nombre 
d&rsquo;individus aussi petit que l&rsquo;on voudroit).&nbsp; 
<i>For if it were once shown that we had right grounds for 
establishing these families</i>; <i>if the point were once gained
that among animals and vegetables there had been</i>, <i>I do not
say several species</i>, <i>but even a single one</i>, <i>which 
had been produced in the course of direct descent </i><!-- page 
176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
176</span><i>from another species</i>; <i>if for example it could
be once shown that the ass was but a degeneration from the 
horse</i>&mdash;<i>then there is no further limit to be set to 
the power of nature</i>, <i>and we should not be wrong in 
supposing that with sufficient time she could have evolved all 
other organised forms from one primordial type</i> (<i>et 
l&rsquo;on n&rsquo;auroit pas tort de supposer</i>, <i>que 
d&rsquo;un seul &ecirc;tre elle a su tirer avec le temps tous les
autres &ecirc;tres organis&eacute;s</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buffon now felt that he had sailed as near the wind as was 
desirable.&nbsp; His next sentence is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&nbsp; It is certain <i>from revelation</i> that
all animals have alike been favoured with the grace of an act of 
direct creation, and that the first pair of every species issued 
full formed from the hands of the Creator.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176" 
class="citation">[176]</a></p>
<p>This might be taken as <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>, if it had been 
written by Bonnet, but it is impossible to accept it from 
Buffon.&nbsp; It is only those who judge him at second hand, or 
by isolated passages, who can hold that he failed to see the 
consequences of his own premises.&nbsp; No one could have seen 
more clearly, nor have said more lucidly, what should suffice to 
show a sympathetic reader the conclusion he ought to come 
to.&nbsp; Even when ironical, his irony is not the ill-natured 
irony of one who is merely amusing himself at other 
people&rsquo;s expense, but the serious and legitimate irony of 
one who must either limit the circle of those to whom he appeals,
or must know how to make the same language appeal differently to 
the different capacities of his readers, and who trusts to the 
good sense of the discerning to understand the difficulty of his 
position and make due allowance for it.</p>
<p>The compromise which he thought fit to put before <!-- page 
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
177</span>the public was that &ldquo;Each species has a type of 
which the principal features are engraved in indelible and 
eternally permanent characters, while all accessory touches 
vary.&rdquo; <a name="citation177a"></a><a href="#footnote177a" 
class="citation">[177a]</a>&nbsp; It would be satisfactory to 
know where an accessory touch is supposed to begin and end.</p>
<p>And again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The essential characteristics of every 
animal have been conserved without alteration in their most 
important parts. . . . The individuals of each genus still 
represent the same forms as they did in the earliest ages, 
especially in the case of the larger animals&rdquo; (so that the 
generic forms even of the larger animals prove not to be the 
same, but only &ldquo;especially&rdquo; the same as in the 
earliest ages). <a name="citation177b"></a><a 
href="#footnote177b" class="citation">[177b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This transparently illogical position is maintained ostensibly
from first to last, much in the same spirit as in the two 
foregoing passages, written at intervals of thirteen years.&nbsp;
But they are to be read by the light of the earlier 
one&mdash;placed as a lantern to the wary upon the threshold of 
his work in 1753&mdash;to the effect that a single, 
well-substantiated case of degeneration would make it conceivable
that all living beings were descended from but one common 
ancestor.&nbsp; If after having led up to this by a remorseless 
logic, a man is found five-and-twenty years later still 
substantiating cases of degeneration, as he has been 
substantiating them unceasingly in thirty quartos during the 
whole interval, there should be little question how seriously we 
are to take him when he wishes us to stop short of the 
conclusions he has told us we ought to draw from the premises 
that he has made it the business of his life to 
establish&mdash;especially when we know that he has a Sorbonne to
keep a sharp eye upon him.</p>
<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>I believe that if the reader will bear in mind the 
twofold, serious and ironical, character of Buffon&rsquo;s work 
he will understand it, and feel an admiration for it which will 
grow continually greater and greater the more he studies it, 
otherwise he will miss the whole point.</p>
<p>Buffon on one of the early pages of his first volume protested
against the introduction of either 
&ldquo;<i>plaisanterie</i>&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;<i>&eacute;quivoque</i>&rdquo; (p. 25) into a serious 
work.&nbsp; But I have observed that there is an unconscious 
irony in most disclaimers of this nature.&nbsp; When a writer 
begins by saying that he has &ldquo;an ineradicable tendency to 
make things clear,&rdquo; we may infer that we are going to be 
puzzled; so when he shows that he is haunted by a sense of the 
impropriety of allowing humour to intrude into his work, we may 
hope to be amused as well as interested.&nbsp; As showing how far
the objection to humour which he expressed upon his twenty-fifth 
page succeeded in carrying him safely over his twenty-sixth and 
twenty-seventh, I will quote the following, which begins on page 
twenty-six:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Aldrovandus is the most learned and 
laborious of all naturalists; after sixty years of work he has 
left an immense number of volumes behind him, which have been 
printed at various times, the greater number of them after his 
death.&nbsp; It would be possible to reduce them to a tenth part 
if we could rid them of all useless and foreign matter, and of a 
prolixity which I find almost overwhelming; were this only done, 
his books should be regarded as among the best we have on the 
subject of natural history in its entirety.&nbsp; The plan of his
work is good, his classification distinguished for its good 
sense, his dividing lines well marked, his descriptions 
sufficiently accurate&mdash;monotonous it is true, but <!-- page 
179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
179</span>painstaking; the historical part of his work is less 
good; it is often confused and fabulous, and the author shows too
manifestly the credulous tendencies of his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While going over his work, I have been struck with that
defect, or rather excess, which we find in almost all the books 
of a hundred or a couple of hundred years ago, and which prevails
still among the Germans&mdash;I mean with that quantity of 
useless erudition with which they intentionally swell out their 
works, and the result of which is that their subject is overlaid 
with a mass of extraneous matter on which they enlarge with great
complacency, but with no consideration whatever for their 
readers.&nbsp; They seem, in fact, to have forgotten what they 
have to say in their endeavour to tell us what has been said by 
other people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I picture to myself a man like Aldrovandus, after he 
has once conceived the design of writing a complete natural 
history.&nbsp; I see him in his library reading, one after the 
other, ancients, moderns, philosophers, theologians, 
jurisconsults, historians, travellers, poets, and reading with no
other end than with that of catching at all words and phrases 
which can be forced from far or near into some kind of relation 
with his subject.&nbsp; I see him copying all these passages, or 
getting them copied for him, and arranging them in alphabetical 
order.&nbsp; He fills many portfolios with all manner of notes, 
often taken without either discrimination or research, and at 
last sets himself to write with a resolve that not one of all 
these notes shall remain unused.&nbsp; The result is that when he
comes to his account of the cow or of the hen, he will tell us 
all that has ever yet been said about cows or hens; all that the 
ancients ever thought about <!-- page 180--><a 
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>them; all 
that has ever been imagined concerning their virtues, characters,
and courage; every purpose to which they have ever yet been put; 
every story of every old woman that he can lay hold of; all the 
miracles which certain religions have ascribed to them; all the 
superstitions they have given rise to; all the metaphors and 
allegories which poets have drawn from them; the attributes that 
have been assigned to them; the representations that have been 
made of them in hieroglyphics and armorial bearings, in a word 
all the histories and all fables in which there was ever yet any 
mention either of a cow or hen.&nbsp; How much natural history is
likely to be found in such a lumber-room? and how is one to lay 
one&rsquo;s hand upon the little that there may actually 
be?&rdquo; <a name="citation180"></a><a href="#footnote180" 
class="citation">[180]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hoped that the reader will see Buffon, much as Buffon 
saw the learned Aldrovandus.&nbsp; He should see him going into 
his library, &amp;c., and quietly chuckling to himself as he 
wrote such a passage as the one in which we lately found him 
saying that the larger animals had &ldquo;especially&rdquo; the 
same generic forms as they had always had.&nbsp; And the reader 
should probably see Daubenton chuckling also.</p>

<h3>RECAPITULATION AND STATEMENT OF AN OBJECTION.&nbsp; (<span 
class="smcap">chapter x. of unconscious memory</span>.) <a 
name="citation181a"></a><a href="#footnote181a" 
class="citation">[181a]</a></h3>
<p>The true theory of unconscious action is that of Professor 
Hering, from whose lecture <a name="citation181b"></a><a 
href="#footnote181b" class="citation">[181b]</a> it is no 
strained conclusion to gather that he holds the action of all 
living beings, from the moment of conception to that of fullest 
development, to be founded in volition and design, though these 
have been so long lost sight of that the work is now carried on, 
as it were, departmentally and in due course according to an 
official routine which can hardly be departed from.</p>
<p>This involves the older &ldquo;Darwinism&rdquo; and the theory
of Lamarck, according to which the modification of living forms 
has been effected mainly through the needs of the living forms 
themselves, which vary with varying conditions&mdash;the survival
of the fittest (which, as I see Mr. H. B. Baildon has just said, 
&ldquo;sometimes comes to mean merely the survival of the 
survivors&rdquo; <a name="citation181c"></a><a 
href="#footnote181c" class="citation">[181c]</a>) <!-- page 
182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
182</span>being taken as a matter of course.&nbsp; According to 
this view of evolution, there is a remarkable analogy between the
development of living organs, or tools, and that of those organs 
or tools external to the body which has been so rapid during the 
last few thousand years.</p>
<p>Animals and plants, according to Professor Hering, are guided 
throughout their development, and preserve the due order in each 
step they take, through memory of the course they took on past 
occasions when in the persons of their ancestors.&nbsp; I am 
afraid I have already too often said that if this memory remains 
for long periods together latent and without effect, it is 
because the vibrations of the molecular substance of the body 
which are its supposed explanation are during these periods too 
feeble to generate action, until they are augmented in force 
through an accession of similar vibrations issuing from exterior 
objects; or, in other words, until recollection is stimulated by 
a return of the associated ideas.&nbsp; On this the internal 
agitation becomes so much enhanced, that equilibrium is visibly 
disturbed, and the action ensues which is proper to the 
vibrations of the particular substance under the particular 
conditions.&nbsp; This, at least, is what I suppose Professor 
Hering to intend.</p>
<p>Leaving the explanation of memory on one side, and confining 
ourselves to the fact of memory only, a caterpillar on being just
hatched is supposed, according to this theory, to lose its memory
of the time it was in the egg, and to be stimulated by an intense
but unconscious recollection of the action taken by its ancestors
when they were first hatched.&nbsp; It is guided in the course it
takes by the experience it can thus command.&nbsp; Each step it 
takes recalls a new recollection, and thus it goes through a 
development as a performer performs <!-- page 183--><a 
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>a piece of 
music, each bar leading his recollection to the bar that should 
next follow.</p>
<p>In Life and Habit will be found examples of the manner in 
which this view solves a number of difficulties for the 
explanation of which the leading men of science express 
themselves at a loss.&nbsp; The following from Professor 
Huxley&rsquo;s recent work upon the crayfish may serve for an 
example.&nbsp; Professor Huxley writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is a widely received notion that the 
energies of living matter have a tendency to decline and finally 
disappear, and that the death of the body as a whole is a 
necessary correlate of its life.&nbsp; That all living beings 
sooner or later perish needs no demonstration, but it would be 
difficult to find satisfactory grounds for the belief that they 
needs must do so.&nbsp; The analogy of a machine, that sooner or 
later must be brought to a standstill by the wear and tear of its
parts, does not hold, inasmuch as the animal mechanism is 
continually renewed and repaired; and though it is true that 
individual components of the body are constantly dying, yet their
places are taken by vigorous successors.&nbsp; A city remains 
notwithstanding the constant death-rate of its inhabitants; and 
such an organism as a crayfish is only a corporate unity, made up
of innumerable partially independent 
individualities.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Crayfish</i>, p. 127.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely the theory which I have indicated above makes the 
reason plain why no organism can permanently outlive its 
experience of past lives.&nbsp; The death of such a body 
corporate as the crayfish is due to the social condition becoming
more complex than there is memory of past experience to deal 
with.&nbsp; Hence social disruption, insubordination, and 
decay.&nbsp; The crayfish dies as a state dies, and all states 
that we have heard of die sooner or later.&nbsp; There are some 
<!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
184</span>savages who have not yet arrived at the conception that
death is the necessary end of all living beings, and who consider
even the gentlest death from old age as violent and abnormal; so 
Professor Huxley seems to find a difficulty in seeing that though
a city commonly outlives many generations of its citizens, yet 
cities and states are in the end no less mortal than 
individuals.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>city</i>,&rdquo; he says, 
&ldquo;remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, but not for ever.&nbsp; When 
Professor Huxley can find a city that will last for ever, he may 
wonder that a crayfish does not last for ever.</p>
<p>I have already here and elsewhere said all that I can yet 
bring forward in support of Professor Hering&rsquo;s theory; it 
now remains for me to meet the most troublesome objection to it 
that I have been able to think of&mdash;an objection which I had 
before me when I wrote Life and Habit, but which then as now I 
believe to be unsound.&nbsp; Seeing, however, that a plausible 
case can be made out for it, I will state it and refute it 
here.&nbsp; When I say refute it, I do not mean that I shall have
done with it&mdash;for it is plain that it opens up a vaster 
question in the relations between the so-called organic and 
inorganic worlds&mdash;but that I will refute the supposition 
that it any way militates against Professor Hering&rsquo;s 
theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; it may be asked, &ldquo;should we go out of
our way to invent unconscious memory&mdash;the existence of which
must at the best remain an inference <a name="citation184"></a><a
href="#footnote184" class="citation">[184]</a>&mdash;when the 
observed fact that like antecedents are invariably followed by 
like consequents should be sufficient for our purpose?&nbsp; Why 
should the fact that a given kind <!-- page 185--><a 
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>of 
chrysalis in a given condition will always become a butterfly 
within a certain time be connected with memory when it is not 
pretended that memory has anything to do with the invariableness 
with which oxygen and hydrogen when mixed in certain proportions 
make water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We assume confidently that if a drop of water were decomposed 
into its component parts, and if these were brought together 
again, and again decomposed and again brought together any number
of times over, the results would be invariably the same, whether 
decomposition or combination, yet no one will refer the 
invariableness of the action during each repetition, to 
recollection by the gaseous molecules of the course taken when 
the process was last repeated.&nbsp; On the contrary, we are 
assured that molecules in some distant part of the world which 
had never entered into such and such a known combination 
themselves, nor held concert with other molecules that had been 
so combined, and which, therefore, could have had no experience 
and no memory, would none the less act upon one another in that 
one way in which other like combinations of atoms have acted 
under like circumstances, as readily as though they had been 
combined and separated and recombined again a hundred or a 
hundred thousand times.&nbsp; It is this assumption, tacitly made
by every man, beast, and plant in the universe, throughout all 
time and in every action of their lives, that has made any 
improvement in action possible&mdash;for it is this which lies at
the root of the power to profit by experience.&nbsp; I do not 
exactly know <i>why</i> we make this assumption, and I cannot 
find out that any one else knows much better than myself, but I 
do not recommend any one to dispute it.</p>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>As we admit of no doubt concerning the main result, so 
we do not suppose an alternative to lie before any atom of any 
molecule at any moment during the process of combination.&nbsp; 
This process is, in all probability, an exceedingly complicated 
one, involving a multitude of actions and subordinate processes, 
which follow one upon the other, and each one of which has a 
beginning, a middle, and an end, though they all come to pass in 
what appears to be an instant of time.&nbsp; Yet at no point do 
we conceive of any atom as swerving ever such a little to right 
or left of a determined course, but invest each one of them with 
so much of the divine attributes as that with it there shall be 
no variableness neither shadow of turning.</p>
<p>We attribute this regularity of action to what we call the 
necessity of things, as determined by the nature of the atoms and
the circumstances in which they are placed.&nbsp; We say that 
only one proximate result can ever arise from any given 
combination.&nbsp; If, then, so great uniformity of action as 
nothing can exceed is manifested by atoms to which no one will 
impute memory, why this desire for memory, as though it were the 
only way of accounting for regularity of action in living 
beings?&nbsp; Sameness of action may be seen abundantly where 
there is no room for anything that we can consistently call 
memory.&nbsp; In these cases we say that it is due to sameness of
substance in same circumstances.</p>
<p>The most cursory reflection upon our actions will show us that
it is no more possible for living action to have more than one 
set of proximate consequents at any given time than for oxygen 
and hydrogen when mixed in the proportions proper for the 
formation of water.&nbsp; Why then not recognise this fact, and 
ascribe <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>repeated similarity of living action
to the reproduction of the necessary antecedents, with no more 
sense of connection between the steps in the action, or memory of
similar action taken before, than we suppose on the part of 
oxygen and hydrogen molecules between the several occasions on 
which they may have been disunited and reunited?</p>
<p>A boy catches the measles not because he remembers having 
caught them in the persons of his father and mother, but because 
he is a fit soil for a certain kind of seed to grow upon.&nbsp; 
In like manner he should be said to grow his nose because he is a
fit combination for a nose to spring from.&nbsp; Dr. X---&rsquo;s
father died of <i>angina pectoris</i> at the age of forty-nine; 
so did Dr. X---.&nbsp; Can it be pretended that Dr. X--- 
remembered having died of <i>angina pectoris</i> at the age of 
forty-nine when in the person of his father, and accordingly, 
when he came to be forty-nine years old himself, died also?&nbsp;
For this to hold, Dr. X---&rsquo;s father must have begotten him 
after he was dead; for the son could not remember the 
father&rsquo;s death before it happened.</p>
<p>As for the diseases of old age, so very commonly inherited, 
they are developed for the most part not only long after the 
average age of reproduction, but at a time when no appreciable 
amount of memory of any previous existence can remain; for a man 
will not have many male ancestors who become parents at over 
sixty years old, nor female ancestors who did so at over 
forty.&nbsp; By our own showing, therefore, recollection can have
nothing to do with the matter.&nbsp; Yet who can doubt that gout 
is due to inheritance as much as eyes and noses?&nbsp; In what 
respects do the two things differ so that we should refer the 
inheritance of eyes and noses to memory, while denying any 
connection between memory <!-- page 188--><a 
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>and 
gout?&nbsp; We may have a ghost of a pretence for saying that a 
man grows a nose by rote, or even that he catches the measles or 
whooping-cough by rote; but do we mean to say that he develops 
the gout by rote in his old age if he comes of a gouty 
family?&nbsp; If, then, rote and red-tape have nothing to do with
the one, why should they with the other?</p>
<p>Remember also the cases in which aged females develop male 
characteristics.&nbsp; Here are growths, often of not 
inconsiderable extent, which make their appearance during the 
decay of the body, and grow with greater and greater vigour in 
the extreme of old age, and even for days after death 
itself.&nbsp; It can hardly be doubted that an especial tendency 
to develop these characteristics runs as an inheritance in 
certain families; here then is perhaps the best case that can be 
found of a development strictly inherited, but having clearly 
nothing whatever to do with memory.&nbsp; Why should not all 
development stand upon the same footing?</p>
<p>A friend who had been arguing with me for some time as above, 
concluded with the following words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you cannot be content with the similar action of 
similar substances (living or non-living) under similar 
circumstances&mdash;if you cannot accept this as an ultimate 
fact, but consider it necessary to connect repetition of similar 
action with memory before you can rest in it and be 
thankful&mdash;be consistent, and introduce this memory which you
find so necessary into the inorganic world also.&nbsp; Either say
that a chrysalis becomes a butterfly because it is the thing that
it is, and, being that kind of thing, must act in such and such a
manner and in such a manner only, so that the act of one 
generation has no more to do with the act of the next than the 
fact of cream being churned into butter in a <!-- page 189--><a 
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>dairy one 
day has to do with other cream being churnable into butter in the
following week&mdash;either say this or else develop some mental 
condition&mdash;which I have no doubt you will be very well able 
to do if you feel the want of it&mdash;in which you can make out 
a case for saying that oxygen and hydrogen on being brought 
together, and cream on being churned, are in some way acquainted 
with, and mindful of, action taken by other cream, and other 
oxygen and hydrogen on past occasions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt inclined to reply that my friend need not twit me with 
being able to develop a mental organism if I felt the need of it,
for his own ingenious attack on my position, and indeed every 
action of his life, was but an example of this omnipresent 
principle.</p>
<p>When he was gone, however, I thought over what he had been 
saying.&nbsp; I endeavoured to see how far I could get on without
volition and memory, and reasoned as follows:&mdash;A repetition 
of like antecedents will be certainly followed by a repetition of
like consequents, whether the agents be men and women or chemical
substances.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there be two cowards perfectly 
similar in every respect, and if they be subjected in a perfectly
similar way to two terrifying agents, which are themselves 
perfectly similar, there are few who will not expect a perfect 
similarity in the running away, even though ten thousand years 
intervene between the original combination and its 
repetition.&rdquo; <a name="citation189"></a><a 
href="#footnote189" class="citation">[189]</a>&nbsp; Here 
certainly there is no coming into play of memory, more than in 
the pan of cream on two successive churning days, yet the action 
is similar.</p>
<p>A clerk in an office has an hour in the middle of the day for 
dinner.&nbsp; About half-past twelve he begins to <!-- page 
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
190</span>feel hungry; at one he takes down his hat and leaves 
the office.&nbsp; He does not yet know the neighbourhood, and on 
getting down into the street asks a policeman at the corner which
is the best eating-house within easy distance.&nbsp; The 
policeman tells him of three houses, one of which is a little 
farther off than the other two, but is cheaper.&nbsp; Money being
a greater object to him than time, the clerk decides on going to 
the cheaper house.&nbsp; He goes, is satisfied, and returns.</p>
<p>Next day he wants his dinner at the same hour, and&mdash;it 
will be said&mdash;remembering his satisfaction of yesterday, 
will go to the same place as before.&nbsp; But what has his 
memory to do with it?&nbsp; Suppose him to have forgotten all the
circumstances of the preceding day from the moment of his 
beginning to feel hungry onward, though in other respects sound 
in mind and body, and unchanged generally.&nbsp; At half-past 
twelve he would begin to be hungry; but his beginning to be 
hungry cannot be connected with his remembering having begun to 
be hungry yesterday.&nbsp; He would begin to be hungry just as 
much whether he remembered or no.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock he 
again takes down his hat and leaves the office, not because he 
remembers having done so yesterday, but because he wants his hat 
to go out with.&nbsp; Being again in the street, and again 
ignorant of the neighbourhood (for he remembers nothing of 
yesterday), he sees the same policeman at the corner of the 
street, and asks him the same question as before; the policeman 
gives him the same answer, and money being still an object to 
him, the cheapest eating-house is again selected; he goes there, 
finds the same <i>menu</i>, makes the same choice for the same 
reasons, eats, is satisfied, and returns.</p>
<p>What similarity of action can be greater than this, <!-- page 
191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
191</span>and at the same time more incontrovertible?&nbsp; But 
it has nothing to do with memory; on the contrary, it is just 
because the clerk has no memory that his action of the second day
so exactly resembles that of the first.&nbsp; As long as he has 
no power of recollecting, he will day after day repeat the same 
actions in exactly the same way, until some external 
circumstances, such as his being sent away, modify the 
situation.&nbsp; Till this or some other modification occurs, he 
will day after day go down into the street without knowing where 
to go; day after day he will see the same policeman at the corner
of the same street, and (for we may as well suppose that the 
policeman has no memory too) he will ask and be answered, and ask
and be answered, till he and the policeman die of old age.&nbsp; 
This similarity of action is plainly due to that&mdash;whatever 
it is&mdash;which ensures that like persons or things when placed
in like circumstances shall behave in a like manner.</p>
<p>Allow the clerk ever such a little memory, and the similarity 
of action will disappear; for the fact of remembering what 
happened to him on the first day he went out in search of dinner 
will be a modification in him in regard to his then condition 
when he next goes out to get his dinner.&nbsp; He had no such 
memory on the first day, and he has upon the second.&nbsp; Some 
modification of action must ensue upon this modification of the 
actor, and this is immediately observable.&nbsp; He wants his 
dinner, indeed, goes down into the street, and sees the policeman
as yesterday, but he does not ask the policeman; he remembers 
what the policeman told him and what he did, and therefore goes 
straight to the eating-house without wasting time: nor does he 
dine off the same dish two days running, for he remembers what he
had yesterday and likes variety.&nbsp; If, then, similarity <!-- 
page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
192</span>of action is rather hindered than promoted by memory, 
why introduce it into such cases as the repetition of the 
embryonic processes by successive generations?&nbsp; The embryos 
of a well-fixed breed, such as the goose, are almost as much 
alike as water is to water, and by consequence one goose comes to
be almost as like another as water to water.&nbsp; Why should it 
not be supposed to become so upon the same grounds&mdash;namely, 
that it is made of the same stuffs, and put together in like 
proportions in the same manner?</p>
<h3><!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>ON CYCLES.&nbsp; (<span 
class="smcap">chapter xi. of unconscious memory</span>.)</h3>
<p>The one faith on which all normal living beings consciously or
unconsciously act, is that like antecedents will be followed by 
like consequents.&nbsp; This is the one true and catholic faith, 
undemonstrable, but except a living being believe which, without 
doubt it shall perish everlastingly.&nbsp; In the assurance of 
this all action is taken.&nbsp; But if this fundamental article 
is admitted, it follows that if ever a complete cycle were 
formed, so that the whole universe of one instant were to repeat 
itself absolutely in a subsequent one, no matter after what 
interval of time, then the course of the events between these two
moments would go on repeating itself for ever and ever afterwards
in due order, down to the minutest detail, in an endless series 
of cycles like a circulating decimal.&nbsp; For the universe 
comprises everything; there could therefore be no disturbance 
from without.&nbsp; Once a cycle, always a cycle.</p>
<p>Let us suppose the earth of given weight, moving with given 
momentum in a given path, and under given conditions in every 
respect, to find itself at any one time conditioned in all these 
respects as it was conditioned at some past moment; then it must 
move exactly in the same path as the one it took when at the 
beginning of the cycle it has just completed, and must therefore 
in the course of time fulfil a second cycle, and therefore <!-- 
page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
194</span>a third, and so on for ever and ever, with no more 
chance of escape than a circulating decimal has, if the 
circumstances have been reproduced with perfect accuracy as to 
draw it into such a whirlpool.</p>
<p>We see something very like this actually happen in the yearly 
revolutions of the planets round the sun.&nbsp; But the relations
between, we will say, the earth and the sun are not reproduced 
absolutely.&nbsp; These relations deal only with a small part of 
the universe, and even in this small part the relation of the 
parts <i>inter se</i> has never yet been reproduced with the 
perfection of accuracy necessary for our argument.&nbsp; They are
liable, moreover, to disturbance from events which may or may not
actually occur (as, for example, our being struck by a comet, or 
the sun&rsquo;s coming within a certain distance of another sun),
but of which, if they do occur, no one can foresee the 
effects.&nbsp; Nevertheless the conditions have been so nearly 
repeated that there is no appreciable difference in the relations
between the earth and sun on one New Year&rsquo;s Day and on 
another, nor is there reason for expecting such change within any
reasonable time.</p>
<p>If there is to be an eternal series of cycles involving the 
whole universe, it is plain that not one single atom must be 
excluded.&nbsp; Exclude a single molecule of hydrogen from the 
ring, or vary the relative positions of two molecules only, and 
the charm is broken; an element of disturbance has been 
introduced, of which the utmost that can be said is that it may 
not prevent the ensuing of a long series of very nearly perfect 
cycles before similarity in recurrence is destroyed, but which 
must inevitably prevent absolute identity of repetition.&nbsp; 
The movement of the series becomes no longer a cycle, but spiral,
and convergent or divergent at a greater or less rate according 
to circumstances.</p>
<p><!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>We cannot conceive of all the atoms in the universe 
standing twice over in absolutely the same relation each one of 
them to every other.&nbsp; There are too many of them, and they 
are too much mixed; but, as has been just said, in the planets 
and their satellites we do see large groups of atoms whose 
movements recur with some approach to precision.&nbsp; The same 
holds good also with certain comets and with the sun 
himself.&nbsp; The result is that our days and nights and seasons
follow one another with nearly perfect regularity from year to 
year, and have done so for as long time as we know anything for 
certain.&nbsp; A vast preponderance of all the action that takes 
place around us is cyclical action.&nbsp; Within the great cycle 
of the planetary revolution of our own earth, and as a 
consequence thereof, we have the minor cycle of the seasons; 
these generate atmospheric cycles.&nbsp; Water is evaporated from
the ocean and conveyed to mountain-ranges, where it is cooled, 
and whence it returns again to the sea.&nbsp; This cycle of 
events is being repeated again and again with little appreciable 
variation.&nbsp; The tides, and winds in certain latitudes, go 
round and round the world with what amounts to continuous 
regularity.&nbsp; There are storms of wind and rain called 
cyclones.&nbsp; In the case of these, the cycle is not very 
complete, the movement, therefore, is spiral, and the tendency to
recur is comparatively soon lost.&nbsp; It is a common saying 
that history repeats itself, so that anarchy will lead to 
despotism and despotism to anarchy; every nation can point to 
instances of men&rsquo;s minds having gone round and round so 
nearly in a perfect cycle that many revolutions have occurred 
before the cessation of a tendency to recur.&nbsp; Lastly, in the
generation of plants and animals we have, perhaps, the most 
striking and <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>common example of the inevitable 
tendency of all action to repeat itself when it has once 
proximately done so.&nbsp; Let only one living being have once 
succeeded in producing a being like itself, and thus have 
returned, so to speak, upon itself, and a series of generations 
must follow of necessity, unless some matter interfere which had 
no part in the original combination, and, as it may happen, kill 
the first reproductive creature or all its descendants within a 
few generations.&nbsp; If no such mishap occurs as this, and if 
the recurrence of the conditions is sufficiently perfect, a 
series of generations follows with as much certainty as a series 
of seasons follows upon the cycle of the relations between the 
earth and sun.</p>
<p>Let the first periodically recurring substance&mdash;we will 
say A&mdash;be able to recur or reproduce itself, not once only, 
but many times over, as A<sup>1</sup>, A<sup>2</sup>, &amp;c.; 
let A also have consciousness and a sense of self-interest, which
qualities must, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, be reproduced in each one of
its offspring; let these get placed in circumstances which differ
sufficiently to destroy the cycle in theory without doing so 
practically&mdash;that is to say, to reduce the rotation to a 
spiral, but to a spiral with so little deviation from perfect 
cycularity as for each revolution to appear practically a cycle, 
though after many revolutions the deviation becomes perceptible; 
then some such differentiations of animal and vegetable life as 
we actually see follow as matters of course.&nbsp; A<sup>1</sup> 
and A<sup>2</sup> have a sense of self-interest as A had, but 
they are not precisely in circumstances similar to A&rsquo;s, 
nor, it may be, to each other&rsquo;s; they will therefore act 
somewhat differently, and every living being is modified by a 
change of action.&nbsp; Having become modified, they follow the 
spirit of A&rsquo;s action <!-- page 197--><a 
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>more 
essentially in begetting a creature like themselves than in 
begetting one like A; for the essence of A&rsquo;s act was not 
the reproduction of A, but the reproduction of a creature like 
the one from which it sprung&mdash;that is to say, a creature 
bearing traces in its body of the main influences that have 
worked upon its parent.</p>
<p>Within the cycle of reproduction there are cycles upon cycles 
in the life of each individual, whether animal or plant.&nbsp; 
Observe the action of our lungs and heart, how regular it is, and
how a cycle having been once established, it is repeated many 
millions of times in an individual of average health and 
longevity.&nbsp; Remember also that it is this 
periodicity&mdash;this inevitable tendency of all atoms in 
combination to repeat any combination which they have once 
repeated, unless forcibly prevented from doing so&mdash;which 
alone renders nine-tenths of our mechanical inventions of 
practical use to us.&nbsp; There is not internal periodicity 
about a hammer or a saw, but there is in the steam-engine or 
watermill when once set in motion.&nbsp; The actions of these 
machines recur in a regular series, at regular intervals, with 
the unerringness of circulating decimals.</p>
<p>When we bear in mind, then, the omnipresence of this tendency 
in the world around us, the absolute freedom from exception which
attends its action, the manner in which it holds equally good 
upon the vastest and the smallest scale, and the completeness of 
its accord with our ideas of what must inevitably happen when a 
like combination is placed in circumstances like those in which 
it was placed before&mdash;when we bear in mind all this, is it 
possible not to connect the facts together, and to refer cycles 
of living generations to the same unalterableness in the action

of a steam-engine move up and down as long as the steam acts upon

<p>But who will attribute memory to the hands of a clock, to a

evaporation, to the earth and planets in their circuits round the

into the embryonic development of living beings, when there is 
not a particle of evidence in support of its actual presence, 
when regularity of action can be ensured just as well without it 
as with it, and when at the best it is considered as existing 
under circumstances which it baffles us to conceive, inasmuch as 
it is supposed to be exercised without any conscious 
recollection?&nbsp; Surely a memory which is exercised without 
any consciousness of recollecting is only a periphrasis for the 
absence of any memory at all. <a name="citation198b"></a><a

<h3><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>REPUTATION&mdash;MEMORY AT ONCE A 
PROMOTER AND A DISTURBER OF UNIFORMITY OF ACTION AND 
STRUCTURE.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">chapter xii. of unconscious
memory</span>.)</h3>
<p>To meet the objections in the two foregoing chapters, I need 
do little more than show that the fact of certain often inherited
diseases and developments, whether of youth or old age, being 
obviously not due to a memory on the part of offspring of like 
diseases and developments in the parents, does not militate 
against supposing that embryonic and youthful development 
generally is due to memory.</p>
<p>This is the main part of the objection; the rest resolves 
itself into an assertion that there is no evidence in support of 
instinct and embryonic development being due to memory, and a 
contention that the necessity of each particular moment in each 
particular case is sufficient to account for the facts without 
the introduction of memory.</p>
<p>I will deal with these two last points briefly first.&nbsp; As
regards the evidence in support of the theory that instinct and 
growth are due to a rapid unconscious memory of past experiences 
and developments in the persons of the ancestors of the living 
form in which they appear, I must refer my readers to Life and 
Habit, and to the translation of Professor Hering&rsquo;s lecture
given in Chapter VI. of Unconscious Memory.&nbsp; <!-- page 
200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>I 
will only repeat here that a chrysalis, we will say, is as much 
one and the same person with the chrysalis of its preceding 
generation, as this last is one and the same person with the egg 
or caterpillar from which it sprang.&nbsp; You cannot deny 
personal identity between two successive generations without 
sooner or later denying it during the successive stages in the 
single life of what we call one individual; nor can you admit 
personal identity through the stages of a long and varied life 
(embryonic and post-natal) without admitting it to endure through
an endless series of generations.</p>
<p>The personal identity of successive generations being 
admitted, the possibility of the second of two generations 
remembering what happened to it in the first is obvious.&nbsp; 
The <i>&agrave; priori</i> objection, therefore, is removed, and 
the question becomes one of fact&mdash;does the offspring act as 
if it remembered?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is not only that it does so act, 
but that it is not possible to account for either its development
or its early instinctive actions upon any other hypothesis than 
that of its remembering, and remembering exceedingly well.</p>
<p>The only alternative is to declare with Von Hartmann that a 
living being may display a vast and varied information concerning
all manner of details, and be able to perform most intricate 
operations, independently of experience and practice.&nbsp; Once 
admit knowledge independent of experience, and farewell to sober 
sense and reason from that moment.</p>
<p>Firstly, then, we show that offspring has had every facility 
for remembering; secondly, that it shows every appearance of 
having remembered; thirdly, that no other hypothesis except 
memory can be brought forward, so as to account for the phenomena
of instinct and <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>heredity generally, which is not 
easily reducible to an absurdity.&nbsp; Beyond this we do not 
care to go, and must allow those to differ from us who require 
further evidence.</p>
<p>As regards the argument that the necessity of each moment will
account for likeness of result, without there being any need for 
introducing memory, I admit that likeness of consequents is due 
to likeness of antecedents, and I grant this will hold as good 
with embryos as with oxygen and hydrogen gas; what will cover the
one will cover the other, for the writs of the laws common to all
matter run within the womb as freely as elsewhere; but admitting 
that there are combinations into which living beings enter with a
faculty called memory which has its effects upon their conduct, 
and admitting that such combinations are from time to time 
repeated (as we observe in the case of a practised performer 
playing a piece of music which he has committed to memory), then 
I maintain that though, indeed, the likeness of one performance 
to its immediate predecessor is due to likeness of the 
combinations immediately preceding the two performances, yet 
memory plays so important a part in both these combinations as to
make it a distinguishing feature in them, and therefore proper to
be insisted upon.&nbsp; We do not, for example, say that Herr 
Joachim played such and such a sonata without the music, because 
he was such and such an arrangement of matter in such and such 
circumstances, resembling those under which he played without 
music on some past occasion.&nbsp; This goes without saying; we 
say only that he played the music by heart or by memory, as he 
had often played it before.</p>
<p>To the objector that a caterpillar becomes a chrysalis <!-- 
page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
202</span>not because it remembers and takes the action taken by 
its fathers and mothers in due course before it, but because when
matter is in such a physical and mental state as to be called 
caterpillar, it must perforce assume presently such another 
physical and mental state as to be called chrysalis, and that 
therefore there is no memory in the case&mdash;to this objector I
rejoin that the offspring caterpillar would not have become so 
like the parent as to make the next or chrysalis stage a matter 
of necessity, unless both parent and offspring had been 
influenced by something that we usually call memory.&nbsp; For it
is this very possession of a common memory which has guided the 
offspring into the path taken by, and hence to a virtually same 
condition with, the parent, and which guided the parent in its 
turn to a state virtually identical with a corresponding state in
the existence of its own parent.&nbsp; To memory, therefore, the 
most prominent place in the transaction is assigned rightly.</p>
<p>To deny that will guided by memory has anything to do with the
development of embryos seems like denying that a desire to 
obstruct has anything to do with the recent conduct of certain 
members in the House of Commons.&nbsp; What should we think of 
one who said that the action of these gentlemen had nothing to do
with a desire to embarrass the Government, but was simply the 
necessary outcome of the chemical and mechanical forces at work, 
which being such and such, the action which we see is inevitable,
and has therefore nothing to do with wilful obstruction?&nbsp; We
should answer that there was doubtless a great deal of chemical 
and mechanical action in the matter; perhaps, for aught we knew 
or cared, it was all chemical and mechanical; but if so, then a 
desire to obstruct <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>parliamentary business is involved 
in certain kinds of chemical and mechanical action, and that the 
kinds involving this had preceded the recent proceedings of the 
members in question.&nbsp; If asked to prove this, we can get no 
further than that such action as has been taken has never been 
seen except as following after and in consequence of a desire to 
obstruct; that this is our nomenclature, and that we can no more 
be expected to change it than to change our mother tongue at the 
bidding of a foreigner.</p>
<p>A little reflection will convince the reader that he will be 
unable to deny will and memory to the embryo without at the same 
time denying their existence everywhere, and maintaining that 
they have no place in the acquisition of a habit, nor indeed in 
any human action.&nbsp; He will feel that the actions, and the 
relation of one action to another which he observes in embryos is
such as is never seen except in association with and as a 
consequence of will and memory.&nbsp; He will therefore say that 
it is due to will and memory.&nbsp; To say that these are the 
necessary outcome of certain antecedents is not to destroy them: 
granted that they are&mdash;a man does not cease to be a man when
we reflect that he has had a father and mother, neither do will 
and memory cease to be will and memory on the ground that they 
cannot come causeless.&nbsp; They are manifest minute by minute 
to the perception of all people who can keep out of lunatic 
asylums, and this tribunal, though not infallible, is 
nevertheless our ultimate court of appeal&mdash;the final 
arbitrator in all disputed cases.</p>
<p>We must remember that there is no action, however original or 
peculiar, which is not in respect of far the greater number of 
its details founded upon memory.&nbsp; If a desperate man blows 
his brains out&mdash;an action which he can do once in a lifetime
only, and which <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>none of his ancestors can have done 
before leaving offspring&mdash;still nine hundred and ninety-nine
thousandths of the movements necessary to achieve his end consist
of habitual movements&mdash;movements, that is to say, which were
once difficult, but which have been practised and practised by 
the help of memory until they are now performed 
automatically.&nbsp; We can no more have an action than a 
creative effort of the imagination cut off from memory.&nbsp; 
Ideas and actions seem almost to resemble matter and force in 
respect of the impossibility of originating or destroying them; 
nearly all that are, are memories of other ideas and actions, 
transmitted but not created, disappearing but not perishing.</p>
<p>It appears, then, that when in Chapter X. we supposed the 
clerk who wanted his dinner to forget on a second day the action 
he had taken the day before, we still, without perhaps perceiving
it, supposed him to be guided by memory in all the details of his
action, such as his taking down his hat and going out into the 
street.&nbsp; We could not, indeed, deprive him of all memory 
without absolutely paralysing his action.</p>
<p>Nevertheless new ideas, new faiths, and new actions do in the 
course of time come about, the living expressions of which we may
see in the new forms of life which from time to time have arisen 
and are still arising, and in the increase of our own knowledge 
and mechanical inventions.&nbsp; But it is only a very little new
that is added at a time, and that little is generally due to the 
desire to attain an end which cannot be attained by any of the 
means for which there exists a perceived precedent in the 
memory.&nbsp; When this is the case, either the memory is further
ransacked for any forgotten shreds of details a combination of 
which may serve the desired purpose; or action is taken in the 
<!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
205</span>dark, which sometimes succeeds and becomes a fertile 
source of further combinations; or we are brought to a dead 
stop.&nbsp; All action is random in respect of any of the minute 
actions which compose it that are not done in consequence of 
memory, real or supposed.&nbsp; So that random, or action taken 
in the dark, or illusion, lies at the very root of progress.</p>
<p>I will now consider the objection that the phenomena of 
instinct and embryonic development ought not to be ascribed to 
memory, inasmuch as certain other phenomena of heredity, such as 
gout, cannot be ascribed to it.</p>
<p>Those who object in this way forget that our actions fall into
two main classes: those which we have often repeated before by 
means of a regular series of subordinate actions beginning and 
ending at a certain tolerably well-defined point&mdash;as when 
Herr Joachim plays a sonata in public, or when we dress or 
undress ourselves; and actions the details of which are indeed 
guided by memory, but which in their general scope and purpose 
are new&mdash;as when we are being married, or presented at 
court.</p>
<p>At each point in any action of the first of the two kinds 
above referred to there is a memory (conscious or unconscious 
according to the less or greater number of times the action has 
been repeated), not only of the steps in the present and previous
performances which have led up to the particular point that may 
be selected, <i>but also of the particular point itself</i>; 
there is therefore, at each point in a habitual performance, a 
memory at once of like antecedents <i>and of a like 
present</i>.</p>
<p>If the memory, whether of the antecedent or the present, were 
absolutely perfect; that is to say, if the vibrations in the 
nervous system (or, if the reader likes <!-- page 206--><a 
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>it better, 
if the molecular change in the particular nerves 
affected&mdash;for molecular change is only a change in the 
character of the vibrations going on within the 
molecules&mdash;it is nothing else than this)&mdash;it the 
vibrations in the particular nerves affected by any occurrence 
continued on each fresh repetition of the occurrence in their 
full original strength and without having been interfered with by
any other vibrations; and if, again, the new waves running into 
the faint old ones from exterior objects and restoring the lapsed
molecular state of the nerves to a pristine condition were 
absolutely identical in character on each repetition of the 
occurrence with the waves that ran in upon the last occasion, 
then there would be no change in the action, and no modification 
or improvement could take place.&nbsp; For though indeed the 
latest performance would always have one memory more than the 
latest but one to guide it, yet the memories being identical, it 
would not matter how many or how few they were.</p>
<p>On any repetition, however, the circumstances, external or 
internal, or both, never are absolutely identical: there is some 
slight variation in each individual case, and some part of this 
variation is remembered, with approbation or disapprobation as 
the case may be.</p>
<p>The fact, therefore, that on each repetition of the action 
there is one memory more than on the last but one, and that this 
memory is slightly different from its predecessor, is seen to be 
an inherent and, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, necessarily disturbing 
factor in all habitual action&mdash;and the life of an organism 
should, as has been sufficiently insisted on, be regarded as the 
habitual action of a single individual, namely, of the organism 
itself, and of its ancestors.&nbsp; This is the key to 
accumulation of improvement, whether in the arts which we 
assiduously <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>practise during our single life, or 
in the structures and instincts of successive generations.&nbsp; 
The memory does not complete a true circle, but is, as it were, a
spiral slightly divergent therefrom.&nbsp; It is no longer a 
perfectly circulating decimal.&nbsp; Where, on the other hand, 
there is no memory of a like present, where, in fact, the memory 
is not, so to speak, spiral, there is no accumulation of 
improvement.&nbsp; The effect of any variation is not 
transmitted, and is not thus pregnant of still further 
change.</p>
<p>As regards the second of the two classes of actions above 
referred to&mdash;those, namely which are not recurrent or 
habitual, <i>and at no point of which is there a memory of a past
present like the one which is present now</i>&mdash;there will 
have been no accumulation of strong and well-knit memory as 
regards the action as a whole, but action, if taken at all, will 
be taken upon disjointed fragments of individual actions (our own
and those of other people) pieced together with a result more or 
less satisfactory according to circumstances.</p>
<p>But it does not follow that the action of two people who have 
had tolerably similar antecedents and are placed in tolerably 
similar circumstances should be more unlike each other in this 
second case than in the first.&nbsp; On the contrary, nothing is 
more common than to observe the same kind of people making the 
same kind of mistake when placed for the first time in the same 
kind of new circumstances.&nbsp; I did not say that there would 
be no sameness of action without memory of a like present.&nbsp; 
There may be sameness of action proceeding from a memory, 
conscious or unconscious, of like antecedents, and <i>a presence 
only of like presents without recollection of the same</i>.</p>
<p>The sameness of action of like persons placed under <!-- page 
208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
208</span>like circumstances for the first time, resembles the 
sameness of action of inorganic matter under the same 
combinations.&nbsp; Let us for a moment suppose what we call 
non-living substances to be capable of remembering their 
antecedents, and that the changes they undergo are the 
expressions of their recollections.&nbsp; Then I admit, of 
course, that there is not memory in any cream, we will say, that 
is about to be churned of the cream of the preceding week, but 
the common absence of such memory from each week&rsquo;s cream is
an element of sameness between the two.&nbsp; And though no cream
can remember having been churned before, yet all cream in all 
time has had nearly identical antecedents, and has therefore 
nearly the same memories and nearly the same proclivities.&nbsp; 
Thus, in fact, the cream of one week is as truly the same as the 
cream of another; week from the same cow, pasture, &amp;c., as 
anything is ever the same with anything; for the having been 
subjected to like antecedents engenders the closest similarity 
that we can conceive of, if the substances were like to start 
with.&nbsp; Same is as same does.</p>
<p>The manifest absence of any connecting memory (or memory of 
like presents) from certain of the phenomena of heredity, such 
as, for example, the diseases of old age, is now seen to be no 
valid reason for saying that such other and far more numerous and
important phenomena as those of embryonic development are not 
phenomena of memory.&nbsp; Growth and the diseases of old age do 
indeed, at first sight, appear to stand on the same 
footing.&nbsp; The question, however, whether certain results are
due to memory or no must be settled not by showing that two 
combinations, neither of which can remember the other (as between
each other), may yet generate like results, and therefore, 
considering the <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>memory theory disposed of for all 
other cases, but by the evidence we may be able to adduce in any 
particular case that the second agent has actually remembered the
conduct of the first.&nbsp; Such evidence must show firstly that 
the second agent cannot be supposed able to do what it is plain 
he can do, except under the guidance of memory or experience, and
secondly, that the second agent has had every opportunity of 
remembering.&nbsp; When the first of these tests fails, 
similarity of action on the part of two agents need not be 
connected with memory of a like present as well as of like 
antecedents; when both fail, similarity of action should be 
referred to memory of like antecedents only.</p>
<p>Returning to a parenthesis a few pages back, in which I said 
that consciousness of memory would be less or greater according 
to the greater or fewer number of times that the act had been 
repeated, it may be observed as a corollary to this, that the 
less consciousness of memory the greater the uniformity of 
action, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.&nbsp; For the less 
consciousness involves the memory&rsquo;s being more perfect, 
through a larger number (generally) of repetitions of the act 
that is remembered; there is therefore a less proportionate 
difference in respect of the number of recollections of this 
particular act between the most recent actor and the most recent 
but one.&nbsp; This is why very old civilisations, as those of 
many insects, and the greater number of now living organisms, 
appear to the eye not to change at all.</p>
<p>For example, if an action has been performed only ten times, 
we will say by A, B, C, &amp;c, who are similar in all respects, 
except that A acts without recollection, B with recollection of 
A&rsquo;s action, C with recollection of both B&rsquo;s and 
A&rsquo;s, while J remembers the course taken by A, B, C, D, E, 
F, G, H, and I&mdash;the possession of a <!-- page 210--><a 
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>memory by B
will indeed so change his action, as compared with A&rsquo;s, 
that it may well be hardly recognisable.&nbsp; We saw this in our
example of the clerk who asked the policeman the way to the 
eating-house on one day, but did not ask him the next, because he
remembered; but C&rsquo;s action will not be so different from 
B&rsquo;s as B&rsquo;s from A&rsquo;s, for though C will act with
a memory of two occasions on which the action has been performed,
while B recollects only the original performance by A, yet B and 
C both act with the guidance of a memory and experience of some 
kind, while A acted without any.&nbsp; Thus the clerk referred to
in Chapter X. will act on the third day much as he acted on the 
second&mdash;that is to say, he will see the policeman at the 
corner of the street, but will not question him.</p>
<p>When the action is repeated by J for the tenth time, the 
difference between J&rsquo;s repetition of it and I&rsquo;s will 
be due solely to the difference between a recollection of nine 
past performances by J against only eight by I, and this is so 
much proportionately less than the difference between a 
recollection of two performances and of only one, that a less 
modification of action should be expected.&nbsp; At the same time
consciousness concerning an action repeated for the tenth time 
should be less acute than on the first repetition.&nbsp; Memory, 
therefore, though tending to disturb similarity of action less 
and less continually, must always cause some disturbance.&nbsp; 
At the same time the possession of a memory on the successive 
repetitions of an action after the first, and, perhaps, the first
two or three, during which the recollection may be supposed still
imperfect, will tend to ensure uniformity, for it will be one of 
the elements of sameness in the agents&mdash;they both acting by 
the light of experience and memory.</p>
<p><!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>During the embryonic stages and in childhood we are 
almost entirely under the guidance of a practised and powerful 
memory of circumstances which have been often repeated, not only 
in detail and piecemeal, but as a whole, and under many slightly 
varying conditions; thus the performance has become well averaged
and matured in its arrangements, so as to meet all ordinary 
emergencies.&nbsp; We therefore act with great unconsciousness 
and vary our performances little.&nbsp; Babies are much more 
alike than persons of middle age.</p>
<p>Up to the average age at which our ancestors have had children
during many generations, we are still guided in great measure by 
memory; but the variations in external circumstances begin to 
make themselves perceptible in our characters.&nbsp; In middle 
life we live more and more continually upon the piecing together 
of details of memory drawn from our personal experience, that is 
to say, upon the memory of our own antecedents; and this 
resembles the kind of memory we hypothetically attached to cream 
a little time ago.&nbsp; It is not surprising, then, that a son 
who has inherited his father&rsquo;s tastes and constitution, and
who lives much as his father had done, should make the same 
mistakes as his father did when he reaches his father&rsquo;s 
age&mdash;we will say of seventy&mdash;though he cannot possibly 
remember his father&rsquo;s having made the mistakes.&nbsp; It 
were to be wished we could, for then we might know better how to 
avoid gout, cancer, or what not.&nbsp; And it is to be noticed 
that the developments of old age are generally things we should 
be glad enough to avoid if we knew how to do so.</p>
<h3><!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>CONCLUSION.&nbsp; (<span 
class="smcap">chapter xiii. of unconscious memory</span>.)</h3>
<p>If we observed the resemblance between successive generations 
to be as close as that between distilled water and distilled 
water through all time, and if we observed that perfect 
unchangeableness in the action of living beings which we see in 
what we call chemical and mechanical combinations, we might 
indeed suspect that memory had as little place among the causes 
of their action as it can have in anything, and that each 
repetition, whether of a habit or the practice of art, or of an 
embryonic process in successive generations, was as original as 
the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; itself, for all that memory 
had to do with it.&nbsp; I submit, however, that in the case of 
the reproductive forms of life we see just so much variety, in 
spite of uniformity, as is consistent with a repetition involving
not only a nearly perfect similarity in the agents and their 
circumstances, but also the little departure therefrom that is 
inevitably involved in the supposition that a memory of like 
presents as well as of like antecedents (as distinguished from a 
memory of like antecedents only) has played a part in their 
development&mdash;a cyclical memory, if the expression may be 
pardoned.</p>
<p>There is life infinitely lower and more minute than any which 
our most powerful microscopes reveal to us, <!-- page 213--><a 
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>but let us 
leave this upon one side and begin with the am&oelig;ba.&nbsp; 
Let us suppose that this &ldquo;structureless&rdquo; morsel of 
protoplasm is, for all its &ldquo;structurelessness,&rdquo; 
composed of an infinite number of living molecules, each one of 
them with hopes and fears of its own, and all dwelling together 
like Tekke Turcomans, of whom we read that they live for plunder 
only, and that each man of them is entirely independent, 
acknowledging no constituted authority, but that some among them 
exercise a tacit and undefined influence over the others.&nbsp; 
Let us suppose these molecules capable of memory, both in their 
capacity as individuals and as societies, and able to transmit 
their memories to their descendants from the traditions of the 
dimmest past to the experiences of their own lifetime.&nbsp; Some
of these societies will remain simple, as having had no history, 
but to the greater number unfamiliar, and therefore striking, 
incidents will from time to time occur, which, when they do not 
disturb memory so greatly as to kill, will leave their impression
upon it.&nbsp; The body or society will remember these incidents 
and be modified by them in its conduct, and therefore more or 
less in its internal arrangements, which will tend inevitably to 
specialisation.&nbsp; This memory of the most striking events of 
varied lifetimes I maintain, with Professor Hering, to be the 
differentiating cause, which, accumulated in countless 
generations, has led up from the am&oelig;ba to man.&nbsp; If 
there had been no such memory, the am&oelig;ba of one generation 
would have exactly resembled the am&oelig;ba of the preceding, 
and a perfect cycle would have been established; the modifying 
effects of an additional memory in each generation have made the 
cycle into a spiral, and into a spiral whose eccentricities, in 
the outset hardly perceptible, is becoming <!-- page 214--><a 
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>greater and
greater with increasing longevity and more complex social and 
mechanical inventions.</p>
<p>We say that the chicken grows the horny tip to its beak with 
which it ultimately pecks its way out of its shell, because it 
remembers having grown it before, and the use it made of 
it.&nbsp; We say that it made it on the same principles as a man 
makes a spade or a hammer, that is to say, as the joint result 
both of desire and experience.&nbsp; When I say experience, I 
mean, experience not only of what will be wanted, but also of the
details of all the means that must be taken in order to effect 
this.&nbsp; Memory, therefore, is supposed to guide the chicken 
not only in respect of the main design, but in respect also of 
every atomic action, so to speak, which goes to make up the 
execution of this design.&nbsp; It is not only the suggestion of 
a plan which is due to memory, but, as Professor Hering has so 
well said, it is the binding power of memory which alone renders 
any consolidation or coherence of action possible, inasmuch as 
without this no action could have parts subordinate one to 
another, yet bearing upon a common end; no part of an action, 
great or small, could have reference to any other part, much less
to a combination of all the parts; nothing, in fact, but ultimate
atoms of actions could ever happen&mdash;these bearing the same 
relation to such an action, we will say, as a railway journey 
from London to Edinburgh as a single molecule of hydrogen to a 
gallon of water.</p>
<p>If asked how it is that the chicken shows no sign of 
consciousness concerning this design, nor yet of the steps it is 
taking to carry it out, we reply that such unconsciousness is 
usual in all cases where an action, and the design which prompts 
it, have been repeated exceedingly often.&nbsp; If, again, we are
asked how we <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>account for the regularity with 
which each step is taken in its due order, we answer that this 
too is characteristic of actions that are done 
habitually&mdash;they being very rarely misplaced in respect of 
any part.</p>
<p>When I wrote Life and Habit, I had arrived at the conclusion 
that memory was the most essential characteristic of life, and 
went so far as to say, &ldquo;Life is that property of matter 
whereby it can remember&mdash;matter which can remember is 
living.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should perhaps have written, &ldquo;Life 
is the being possessed of a memory&mdash;the life of a thing at 
any moment is the memories which at that moment it 
retains;&rdquo; and I would modify the words that immediately 
follow, namely, &ldquo;Matter which cannot remember is 
dead;&rdquo; for they imply that there is such a thing as matter 
which cannot remember anything at all, and this on fuller 
consideration I do not believe to be the case; I can conceive of 
no matter which is not able to remember a little, and which is 
not living in respect of what it can remember.&nbsp; I do not see
how action of any kind (chemical as much as vital) is conceivable
without the supposition that every atom retains a memory of 
certain antecedents.&nbsp; I cannot, however, at this point, 
enter upon the reasons which have compelled me to join the many 
who are now adopting this conclusion.&nbsp; Whether these would 
be deemed sufficient or no, at any rate we cannot believe that a 
system of self-reproducing associations should develop from the 
simplicity of the am&oelig;ba to the complexity of the human body
without the presence of that memory which can alone account at 
once for the resemblances and the differences between successive 
generations, for the arising and the accumulation of 
divergences&mdash;<!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>for the tendency to differ and the 
tendency not to differ.</p>
<p>At parting, therefore, I would recommend the reader to see 
every atom in the universe as living and able to feel and to 
remember, but in a humble way.&nbsp; He must have life eternal, 
as well as matter eternal; and the life and the matter must be 
joined together inseparably as body and soul to one 
another.&nbsp; Thus he will see God everywhere, not as those who 
repeat phrases conventionally, but as people who would have their
words taken according to their most natural and legitimate 
meaning; and he will feel that the main difference between him 
and many of those who oppose him lies in the fact that whereas 
both he and they use the same language, his opponents only half 
mean what they say, while he means it entirely.</p>
<p>The attempt to get a higher form of a life from a lower one is
in accordance with our observation and experience.&nbsp; It is 
therefore proper to be believed.&nbsp; The attempt to get it from
that which has absolutely no life is like trying to get something
out of nothing.&nbsp; The millionth part of a farthing put out to
interest at ten per cent. will in five hundred years become over 
a million pounds, and so long as we have any millionth of a 
millionth of the farthing to start with, our getting as many 
million pounds as we have a fancy for is only a question of time,
but without the initial millionth of a millionth of a millionth 
part, we shall get no increment whatever.&nbsp; A little leaven 
will leaven the whole lump, but there must be <i>some</i> 
leaven.</p>
<p>We should endeavour to see the so-called inorganic as living, 
in respect of the qualities it has in common with the organic, 
rather than the organic as non-living in respect of the qualities
it has in common with the <!-- page 217--><a 
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
217</span>inorganic.&nbsp; True, it would be hard to place 
one&rsquo;s self on the same moral platform as a stone, but this 
is not necessary; it is enough that we should feel the stone to 
have a moral platform of its own, though that platform embraces 
little more than a profound respect for the laws of gravitation, 
chemical affinity, &amp;c.&nbsp; As for the difficulty of 
conceiving a body as living that has not got a reproductive 
system&mdash;we should remember that neuter insects are living 
but are believed to have no reproductive system.&nbsp; Again, we 
should bear in mind that mere assimilation involves all the 
essentials of reproduction, and that both air and water possess 
this power in a very high degree.&nbsp; The essence of a 
reproductive system, then, is found low down in the scheme of 
nature.</p>
<p>At present our leading men of science are in this difficulty; 
on the one hand their experiments and their theories alike teach 
them that spontaneous generation ought not to be accepted; on the
other, they must have an origin for the life of the living forms,
which, by their own theory, have been evolved, and they can at 
present get this origin in no other way than by <i>Deus ex 
machin&acirc;</i> method, which they reject as unproved, or 
spontaneous generation of living from non-living matter, which is
no less foreign to their experience.&nbsp; As a general rule, 
they prefer the latter alternative.&nbsp; So Professor Tyndall, 
in his celebrated article (<i>Nineteenth Century</i>, November 
1878), wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The theory of evolution in its complete form involves 
the assumption that at some period or other of the earth&rsquo;s 
history there occurred what would be now called 
&lsquo;spontaneous generation.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a 
name="citation217"></a><a href="#footnote217" 
class="citation">[217]</a>&nbsp; And so Professor 
Huxley&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>&ldquo;It is argued that a belief in
abiogenesis is a necessary corollary from the doctrine of 
Evolution.&nbsp; This may be&rdquo; [which I submit is equivalent
here to &ldquo;is&rdquo;] &ldquo;true of the occurrence of 
abiogenesis at some time.&rdquo; <a name="citation218"></a><a 
href="#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Huxley goes on to say that however this may be, 
abiogenesis (or spontaneous generation) is not respectable and 
will not do at all now.&nbsp; There may have been one case once; 
this may be winked at, but it must not occur again.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that a single 
particle of living protoplasm should once have appeared on the 
globe as the result of no matter what agency.&nbsp; In the eyes 
of a consistent [!] evolutionist any further [!] independent 
formation of protoplasm would be sheer waste&rdquo;&mdash;and the
sooner the Almighty gets to understand that He must not make that
single act of special creation into a precedent the better for 
Him.</p>
<p>Professor Huxley, in fact, excuses the single case of 
spontaneous generation which he appears to admit, because however
illegitimate, it was still &ldquo;only a very little one,&rdquo; 
and came off a long time ago in a foreign country.&nbsp; For my 
own part I think it will prove in the end more convenient if we 
say that there is a low kind of livingness in every atom of 
matter, and adopt Life eternal as no less inevitable a conclusion
than matter eternal.</p>
<p>It should not be doubted that wherever there is vibration or 
motion there is life and memory, and that there is vibration and 
motion at all times in all things.&nbsp; The reader who takes the
above position will find that he can explain the entry of what he
calls death among what he calls the living, whereas he could by 
<!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
219</span>no means introduce life into his system if he started 
without it.&nbsp; Death is deducible; life is not 
deducible.&nbsp; Death is a change of memories; it is not the 
destruction of all memory.&nbsp; It is as the liquidation of one 
company each member of which will presently join a new one, and 
retain a trifle even of the old cancelled memory, by way of 
greater aptitude for working in concert with other 
molecules.&nbsp; This is why animals feed on grass and on each 
other, and cannot proselytise or convert the rude ground before 
it has been tutored in the first principles of the higher kinds 
of association.</p>
<p>Again, I would recommend the reader to beware of believing 
anything in this book unless he either likes it, or feels angry 
at being told it.&nbsp; If required belief in this or that makes 
a man angry, I suppose he should, as a general rule, swallow it 
whole then and there upon the spot, otherwise he may take it or 
leave it as he likes.</p>
<p>I have not gone far for my facts, nor yet far from them; all 
on which I rest are as open to the reader as to me.&nbsp; If I 
have sometimes used hard terms, the probability is that I have 
not understood them, but have done so by a slip, as one who has 
caught a bad habit from the company he has been lately 
keeping.&nbsp; They should be skipped.</p>
<p>Do not let the reader be too much cast down by the bad 
language with which professional scientists obscure the issue, 
nor by their seeming to make it their business to fog us under 
the pretext of removing our difficulties.&nbsp; It is not the 
ratcatcher&rsquo;s interest to catch all the rats; and, as Handel
observed so sensibly, &ldquo;Every professional gentleman must do
his best for to live.&rdquo;&nbsp; The art of some of our 
philosophers, however, is sufficiently <!-- page 220--><a 
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
220</span>transparent, and consists too often in saying 
&ldquo;organism which . . . must be classified among 
fishes,&rdquo; <a name="citation220a"></a><a href="#footnote220a"
class="citation">[220a]</a> instead of &ldquo;fish&rdquo; and 
then proclaiming that they have &ldquo;an ineradicable tendency 
to try to make things clear.&rdquo; <a name="citation220b"></a><a
href="#footnote220b" class="citation">[220b]</a></p>
<p>If another example is required, here is the following from an 
article than which I have seen few with which I more completely 
agree, or which have given me greater pleasure.&nbsp; If our men 
of science would take to writing in this way, we should be glad 
enough to follow them.&nbsp; The passage I refer to runs 
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Professor Huxley speaks of a &lsquo;verbal 
fog by which the question at issue may be hidden;&rsquo; is there
no verbal fog in the statement that <i>the &aelig;tiology of 
crayfishes resolves itself into a gradual evolution in the course
of the mesozoic and subsequent epochs of the world&rsquo;s 
history of these animals from a primitive astacomorphous 
form</i>?&nbsp; Would it be fog or light that would envelop the 
history of man if we say that the existence of man was explained 
by the hypothesis of his gradual evolution from a primitive 
anthropomorphous form?&nbsp; I should call this fog, not 
light.&rdquo; <a name="citation220c"></a><a href="#footnote220c" 
class="citation">[220c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Especially let him mistrust those who are holding forth about 
protoplasm, and maintaining that this is the only living 
substance.&nbsp; Protoplasm may be, and perhaps is, the 
<i>most</i> living part of an organism, as the most capable of 
retaining vibrations, of a certain character, but this is the 
utmost that can be claimed for it.&nbsp; I have noticed, however,
that protoplasm has not been buoyant lately in the scientific 
market.</p>
<p>Having mentioned protoplasm, I may ask the reader to note the 
breakdown of that school of philosophy <!-- page 221--><a 
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>which 
divided the <i>ego</i> from the <i>non ego</i>.&nbsp; The 
protoplasmists, on the one hand, are whittling away at 
<i>ego</i>, till they have reduced it to a little jelly in 
certain parts of the body, and they will whittle away this too 
presently, if they go on as they are doing now.</p>
<p>Others, again, are so unifying the <i>ego</i> and the <i>non 
ego</i>, that with them there will soon be as little of the 
<i>non ego</i> left as there is of the <i>ego</i> with their 
opponents.&nbsp; Both, however, are so far agreed as that we know
not where to draw the line between the two, and this renders 
nugatory any system which is founded upon a distinction between 
them.</p>
<p>The truth is, that all classification whatever, when we 
examine its <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> closely, is found to
be arbitrary&mdash;to depend on our sense of our own convenience,
and not on any inherent distinction in the nature of the things 
themselves.&nbsp; Strictly speaking, there is only one thing and 
one action.&nbsp; The universe, or God, and the action of the 
universe as a whole.</p>
<p>Lastly, I may predict with some certainty that before long we 
shall find the original Darwinism of Dr. Erasmus Darwin (with an 
infusion of Professor Hering into the bargain) generally accepted
instead of the neo-Darwinism of to-day, and that the variations 
whose accumulation results in species will be recognised as due 
to the wants and endeavours of the living forms in which they 
appear, instead of being ascribed to chance, or, in other words, 
to unknown causes, as by Mr. Charles Darwin&rsquo;s system.&nbsp;
We shall have some idyllic young naturalists bringing up Dr. 
Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s note on <i>Trapa natans</i> <a 
name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221" 
class="citation">[221]</a> and Lamarck&rsquo;s kindred passage on
the descent of <i>Ranunculus hederaceus</i> from <!-- page 
222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
222</span><i>Ranunculus aquatilis</i> <a 
name="citation222a"></a><a href="#footnote222a" 
class="citation">[222a]</a> as fresh discoveries, and be told 
with much happy simplicity, that those animals and plants which 
have felt the need of such a structure have developed it, while 
those which have not wanted it have gone without it.&nbsp; Thus 
it will be declared, every leaf we see around us, every structure
of the minutest insect, will bear witness to the truth of the 
&ldquo;great guess&rdquo; of the greatest of naturalists 
concerning the memory of living matter. <a 
name="citation222b"></a><a href="#footnote222b" 
class="citation">[222b]</a></p>
<p>I dare say the public will not object to this, and am very 
sure that none of the admirers of Mr. Charles Darwin or Mr. 
Wallace will protest against it; but it may be as well to point 
out that this was not the view of the matter taken by Mr. Wallace
in 1858 when he and Mr. Darwin first came forward as preachers of
natural selection.&nbsp; At that time Mr. Wallace saw clearly 
enough the difference between the theory of &ldquo;natural 
selection&rdquo; and that of Lamarck.&nbsp; He wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The hypothesis of Lamarck&mdash;that 
progressive changes in species have been produced by the attempts
of animals to increase the development of their own organs and 
thus modify their structure and habits&mdash;has been repeatedly 
and easily refuted by all writers on the subject of varieties and
species, . . . but the view here developed renders such a 
hypothesis quite unnecessary . . .&nbsp; The powerful retractile 
talons of the falcon and the cat tribes have not been produced or
increased by the volition of those animals, . . . neither did the
giraffe acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the foliage of
the more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck <!-- 
page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
223</span>for this purpose, but because any varieties which 
occurred among its antitypes with a longer neck than usual <i>at 
once secured a fresh range of pasture over the same ground as 
their short-necked companions</i>, <i>and on the first scarcity 
of food were thereby enabled to outlive them</i>&rdquo; (italics 
in original). <a name="citation223a"></a><a href="#footnote223a" 
class="citation">[223a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely the neo-Darwin doctrine, and a denial of 
the mainly fortuitous character of the variations in animal and 
vegetable forms cuts at its root.&nbsp; That Mr. Wallace, after 
years of reflection, still adhered to this view, is proved by his
heading a reprint of the paragraph just quoted from <a 
name="citation223b"></a><a href="#footnote223b" 
class="citation">[223b]</a> with the words &ldquo;Lamarck&rsquo;s
hypothesis very different from that now advanced;&rdquo; nor do 
any of his more recent works show that he has modified his 
opinion.&nbsp; It should be noted that Mr. Wallace does not call 
his work Contributions to the Theory of Evolution, but to that of
Natural Selection.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin, with characteristic caution, only commits himself 
to saying that Mr. Wallace has arrived at <i>almost</i> (italics 
mine) the same general conclusions as he, Mr. Darwin, has done; 
<a name="citation223c"></a><a href="#footnote223c" 
class="citation">[223c]</a> but he still, as in 1859, declares 
that it would be &ldquo;a serious error to suppose that the 
greater number of instincts have been acquired by habit in one 
generation and then transmitted by inheritance to succeeding 
generations,&rdquo; <a name="citation223d"></a><a 
href="#footnote223d" class="citation">[223d]</a> and he still 
<!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
224</span>comprehensively condemns the &ldquo;well-known doctrine
of inherited habit, as advanced by Lamarck.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation224"></a><a href="#footnote224" 
class="citation">[224]</a></p>
<p>As for the statement in the passage quoted from Mr. Wallace, 
to the effect that Lamarck&rsquo;s hypothesis &ldquo;has been 
repeatedly and easily refuted by all writers on the subject of 
varieties and species,&rdquo; it is a very surprising one.&nbsp; 
I have searched Evolution literature in vain for any refutation 
of the Erasmus Darwinian system (for this is what Lamarck&rsquo;s
hypothesis really is), which need make the defenders of that 
system at all uneasy.&nbsp; The best attempt at an answer to 
Erasmus Darwin that has yet been made is Paley&rsquo;s Natural 
Theology, which was throughout obviously written to meet Buffon 
and the Zoonomia.&nbsp; It is the manner of theologians to say 
that such and such an objection &ldquo;has been refuted over and 
over again,&rdquo; without at the same time telling us when and 
where; it is to be regretted that Mr. Wallace has here taken a 
leaf out of the theologians&rsquo; book.&nbsp; His statement is 
one which will not pass muster with those whom public opinion is 
sure in the end to follow.</p>
<p>Did Mr. Herbert Spencer, for example, &ldquo;repeatedly and 
easily refute&rdquo; Lamarck&rsquo;s hypothesis in his brilliant 
article in the <i>Leader</i>, March 20, 1852?&nbsp; On the 
contrary, that article is expressly directed against those 
&ldquo;who cavalierly reject the hypothesis of Lamarck and his 
followers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This article was written six years before
the words last quoted from Mr. Wallace; how absolutely, however, 
does the word &ldquo;cavalierly&rdquo; apply to them!</p>
<p>Does Isidore Geoffrey, again, bear Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s 
assertion out better?&nbsp; In 1859&mdash;that is to say but a 
short time after Mr. Wallace had written&mdash;he wrote as 
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>&ldquo;Such was the language which 
Lamarck heard during his protracted old age, saddened alike by 
the weight of years and blindness; this was what people did not 
hesitate to utter over his grave yet barely closed, and what 
indeed they are still saying&mdash;commonly too without any 
knowledge of what Lamarck maintained, but merely repeating at 
secondhand bad caricatures of his teaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will the time come when we may see Lamarck&rsquo;s
theory discussed&mdash;and, I may as well at once say, refuted in
some important points <a name="citation225a"></a><a 
href="#footnote225a" class="citation">[225a]</a>&mdash;with at 
any rate the respect due to one of the most illustrious masters 
of our science?&nbsp; And when will this theory, the hardihood of
which has been greatly exaggerated, become freed from the 
interpretations and commentaries by the false light of which so 
many naturalists have followed their opinion concerning it?&nbsp;
If its author is to be condemned, let it be, at any rate, not 
before he has been heard.&rdquo; <a name="citation225b"></a><a 
href="#footnote225b" class="citation">[225b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1873 M. Martin published his edition of Lamarck&rsquo;s 
<i>Philosophic Zoologique</i>.&nbsp; He was still able to say, 
with, I believe, perfect truth, that Lamarck&rsquo;s theory has 
&ldquo;never yet had the honour of being discussed 
seriously.&rdquo; <a name="citation225c"></a><a 
href="#footnote225c" class="citation">[225c]</a></p>
<p>Professor Huxley in his article on Evolution is no less 
cavalier than Mr. Wallace.&nbsp; He writes: <a 
name="citation225d"></a><a href="#footnote225d" 
class="citation">[225d]</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lamarck introduced the conception of the 
action of an animal on itself as a factor in producing 
modification.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lamarck did nothing of the kind.&nbsp; It was Buffon and Dr. 
Darwin who introduced this, but more especially Dr. Darwin.&nbsp;
The accuracy of Professor <!-- page 226--><a 
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
226</span>Huxley&rsquo;s statements about the history and 
literature of evolution is like the direct interference of the 
Deity&mdash;it vanishes whenever and wherever I have occasion to 
test it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>a little consideration showed</i>&rdquo; 
(italics mine) &ldquo;that though Lamarck had seized what, as far
as it goes, is a true cause of modification, it is a cause the 
actual effects of which are wholly inadequate to account for any 
considerable modification in animals, and which can have no 
influence whatever in the vegetable world,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>I should be very glad to come across some of the &ldquo;little
consideration&rdquo; which will show this.&nbsp; I have searched 
for it far and wide, and have never been able to find it.</p>
<p>I think Professor Huxley has been exercising some of his 
ineradicable tendency to try to make things clear in the article 
on Evolution, already so often quoted from.&nbsp; We find him (p.
750) pooh-poohing Lamarck, yet on the next page he says, 
&ldquo;How far &lsquo;natural selection&rsquo; suffices for the 
production of species remains to be seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this 
when &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; was already so nearly of 
age!&nbsp; Why, to those who know how to read between a 
philosopher&rsquo;s lines the sentence comes to very nearly the 
same as a declaration that the writer has no great opinion of 
&ldquo;natural selection.&rdquo;&nbsp; Professor Huxley 
continues, &ldquo;Few can doubt that, if not the whole cause, it 
is a very important factor in that operation.&rdquo;&nbsp; A 
philosopher&rsquo;s words should be weighed carefully, and when 
Professor Huxley says, &ldquo;few can doubt,&rdquo; we must 
remember that he may be including himself among the few whom he 
considers to have the power of doubting on this matter.&nbsp; He 
does not say &ldquo;few will,&rdquo; but &ldquo;few <!-- page 
227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
227</span>can&rdquo; doubt, as though it were only the 
enlightened who would have the power of doing so.&nbsp; Certainly
&ldquo;nature&rdquo;&mdash;for that is what &ldquo;natural 
selection&rdquo; comes to&mdash;is rather an important factor in 
the operation, but we do not gain much by being told so.&nbsp; If
however, Professor Huxley neither believes in the origin of 
species, through sense of need on the part of animals themselves,
nor yet in &ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo; we should be glad to 
know what he does believe in.</p>
<p>The battle is one of greater importance than appears at first 
sight.&nbsp; It is a battle between teleology and non-teleology, 
between the purposiveness and the non-purposiveness of the organs
in animal and vegetable bodies.&nbsp; According to Erasmus 
Darwin, Lamarck, and Paley, organs are purposive; according to 
Mr. Darwin and his followers, they are not purposive.&nbsp; But 
the main arguments against the system of Dr. Erasmus Darwin are 
arguments which, so far as they have any weight, tell against 
evolution generally.&nbsp; Now that these have been disposed of, 
and the prejudice against evolution has been overcome, it will be
seen that there is nothing to be said against the system of 
Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck which does not tell with far greater 
force against that of Mr. Charles Darwin and Mr. Wallace.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 228</span>REMARKS ON MR. ROMANES&rsquo; MENTAL
EVOLUTION IN ANIMALS. <a name="citation228a"></a><a 
href="#footnote228a" class="citation">[228a]</a></h2>
<p>I have said on page 96 of this book that the word 
&ldquo;heredity&rdquo; may be a very good way of stating the 
difficulty which meets us when we observe the reappearance of 
like characteristics, whether of body or mind, in successive 
generations, but that it does nothing whatever towards removing 
it.</p>
<p>It is here that Mr. Herbert Spencer, the late Mr. G. H. Lewes,
and Mr. Romanes fail.&nbsp; Mr. Herbert Spencer does indeed go so
far in one place as to call instinct &ldquo;organised 
memory,&rdquo; <a name="citation228b"></a><a href="#footnote228b"
class="citation">[228b]</a> and Mr. G. H. Lewes attributes many 
instincts to what he calls the &ldquo;lapsing of 
intelligence.&rdquo; <a name="citation228c"></a><a 
href="#footnote228c" class="citation">[228c]</a>&nbsp; So does 
Mr. Herbert Spencer, <a name="citation228d"></a><a 
href="#footnote228d" class="citation">[228d]</a> whom Mr. Romanes
should have known that Mr. Lewis was following.&nbsp; Mr. 
Romanes, in his recent work, Mental Evolution in Animals 
(November, 1883), endorses this, and frequently uses such 
expressions as &ldquo;the lifetime of the species,&rdquo; <a 
name="citation228e"></a><a href="#footnote228e" 
class="citation">[228e]</a> &ldquo;hereditary experience,&rdquo; 
<a name="citation228f"></a><a href="#footnote228f" 
class="citation">[228f]</a> and &ldquo;hereditary memory and 
instinct,&rdquo; <a name="citation228g"></a><a 
href="#footnote228g" class="citation">[228g]</a> but none of 
these writers (and indeed no writer that I know of except 
Professor Hering of Prague, for a translation of whose address on
this subject I must refer the reader <!-- page 229--><a 
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>to my book 
Unconscious Memory) has shown a comprehension of the fact that 
these expressions are unexplained so long as 
&ldquo;heredity,&rdquo; whereby they explain them, is 
unexplained; and none of them sees the importance of emphasizing 
Memory, and making it as it were the keystone of the system.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer may very well call instinct &ldquo;organised 
memory&rdquo; if he means that offspring can 
remember&mdash;within the limitations to which all memory is 
subject&mdash;what happened to it while it was yet in the person 
or persons of its parent or parents; but if he does not mean 
this, his use of the word &ldquo;memory,&rdquo; his talk about 
&ldquo;the experience of the race,&rdquo; and other expressions 
of kindred nature, are delusive.&nbsp; If he does mean this, it 
is a pity he has nowhere said so.</p>
<p>Professor Hering does mean this, and makes it clear that he 
does so.&nbsp; He does not catch the ball and let it slip through
his fingers again, but holds it firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is to 
memory,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that we owe almost all that we 
have or are; our ideas and conceptions are its work; our every 
thought and movement are derived from this source.&nbsp; Memory 
connects the countless phenomena of our existence into a single 
whole, and as our bodies would be scattered into the dust of 
their component atoms if they were not held together by the 
cohesion of matter, so our consciousness would be broken up into 
as many moments as we had lived seconds, but for the binding and 
unifying force of Memory.&rdquo; <a name="citation229"></a><a 
href="#footnote229" class="citation">[229]</a>&nbsp; And he 
proceeds to show that Memory persists between generations exactly
as it does between the various stages in the life of the 
individual.&nbsp; If I could find any such passage as the one I 
have just <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>quoted, in Mr. Herbert 
Spencer&rsquo;s, Mr. Lewes&rsquo;s, or Mr. Romanes&rsquo; works, 
I should be only too glad to quote it, but I know of nothing 
comparable to it for definiteness of idea, thoroughness and 
consistency.</p>
<p>No reader indeed can rise from a perusal of Mr. Herbert 
Spencer&rsquo;s, or Mr. G. H. Lewes&rsquo;, work with an 
adequate&mdash;if indeed with any&mdash;impression that the 
phenomena of heredity are in fact phenomena of memory; that 
heredity, whether as regards body or mind, is only possible 
because each generation is linked on to and made one with its 
predecessor by the possession of a common and abiding memory, in 
as far as bodily existence was common&mdash;that is to say, until
the substance of the one left the substance of the other; and 
that this memory is exactly of the same general character as that
which enables us to remember what we did half an hour 
ago&mdash;strong under the same circumstances as those under 
which this familiar kind of memory is strong, and weak under 
those under which it is weak.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer and Mr. Lewes 
have even less conception of the connection between heredity and 
memory than Dr. Erasmus Darwin had at the close of the last 
century. <a name="citation230"></a><a href="#footnote230" 
class="citation">[230]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Lewes&rsquo; position was briefly this.&nbsp; He denied 
that there could be any knowledge independent of experience, but 
he could not help seeing that young animals come into the world 
furnished with many organs which they use with great dexterity at
a very early age.&nbsp; This looks as if they are acting on 
knowledge acquired independently of experience.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says Mr. Lewes, &ldquo;not so.&nbsp; They are 
born with the organs&mdash;I cannot tell how or why, but heredity
explains all that, and having once got the organs, the objects 
<!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
231</span>that come into contact with them in daily life 
naturally produce the same effect as on the parents, just as 
oxygen coming into contact with the right quantity of hydrogen 
will make water; hence even the first time the offspring come 
into contact with any given object they act as their parents 
did.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of the young having got their 
experience in a past generation does not seem to have even 
crossed his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What marvel is there,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;that 
constant conditions acting upon structures which are similar 
should produce similar results?&nbsp; It is in this sense that 
the paradox of Leibnitz is true, and we can be said &lsquo;to 
acquire an innate idea;&rsquo; only the idea is not acquired 
independently of experience, but through the process of 
experience similar to that which originally produced it.&rdquo; 
<a name="citation231a"></a><a href="#footnote231a" 
class="citation">[231a]</a></p>
<p>The impression left upon me is that he is all at sea for want 
of the clue with which Professor Hering would have furnished him,
and that had that clue been presented to him a dozen years or so 
earlier than it was he would have adopted it.</p>
<p>As regards Mr. Romanes the case is different.&nbsp; His recent
work, Mental Evolution in Animals, <a name="citation231b"></a><a 
href="#footnote231b" class="citation">[231b]</a> shows that he is
well aware of the direction which modern opinion is taking, and 
in several places he so writes as to warrant me in claiming his 
authority in support of the views which I have been insisting on 
for several years past.</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Romanes says that the analogies between the memory 
with which we are familiar in daily life and hereditary memory 
&ldquo;are so numerous and precise&rdquo; <!-- page 232--><a 
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>as to 
justify us in considering them to be of essentially the same 
kind. <a name="citation232a"></a><a href="#footnote232a" 
class="citation">[232a]</a></p>
<p>Again he says that although the memory of milk shown by 
new-born infants is &ldquo;at all events in large part 
hereditary, it is none the less memory&rdquo; of a certain kind. 
<a name="citation232b"></a><a href="#footnote232b" 
class="citation">[232b]</a></p>
<p>Two lines lower down he writes of &ldquo;hereditary memory or 
instinct,&rdquo; thereby implying that instinct is 
&ldquo;hereditary memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes no 
essential difference,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;whether the past 
sensation was actually experienced by the individual itself, or 
bequeathed it, so to speak, by its ancestors. <a 
name="citation232c"></a><a href="#footnote232c" 
class="citation">[232c]</a>&nbsp; For it makes no essential 
difference whether the nervous changes . . . were occasioned 
during the lifetime of the individual or during that of the 
species, and afterwards impressed by heredity on the 
individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lower down on the same page he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As showing how close is the connection 
between hereditary memory and instinct,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the following page:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And this shows how closely the phenomena of
hereditary memory are related to those of individual memory: at 
this stage . . . it is practically impossible to disentangle the 
effects of hereditary memory from those of the 
individual.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Another point which we have here to 
consider is the part which heredity has played in forming the 
perceptive faculty of the individual prior to its own 
experience.&nbsp; We have already seen that heredity plays an 
important part in forming memory of ancestral experiences, and 
thus it is that many animals come <!-- page 233--><a 
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>into the 
world with their power of perception already largely developed. .
. .&nbsp; The wealth of ready-formed information, and therefore 
of ready-made powers of perception, with which many newly-born or
newly-hatched animals are provided, is so great and so precise 
that it scarcely requires to be supplemented by the subsequent 
experience of the individual.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation233a"></a><a href="#footnote233a" 
class="citation">[233a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Instincts probably owe their origin and 
development to one or other of two principles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I.&nbsp; The first mode of origin consists in natural 
selection or survival of the fittest, continuously preserving 
actions, &amp;c. &amp;c. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;II.&nbsp; The second mode of origin is as 
follows:&mdash;By the effects of habit in successive generations,
actions which were originally intelligent become as it were 
stereotyped into permanent instincts.&nbsp; Just as in the 
lifetime of the individual adjustive actions which were 
originally intelligent may by frequent repetition become 
automatic, so in the lifetime of species actions originally 
intelligent may by frequent repetition and heredity so write 
their effects on the nervous system that the latter is prepared, 
even before individual experience, to perform adjustive actions 
mechanically which in previous generations were performed 
intelligently.&nbsp; This mode of origin of instincts has been 
appropriately called (by Lewes&mdash;see Problems of Life and 
Mind <a name="citation233b"></a><a href="#footnote233b" 
class="citation">[233b]</a>) the &lsquo;lapsing of 
intelligence.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation233c"></a><a 
href="#footnote233c" class="citation">[233c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That &lsquo;practice makes perfect&rsquo; 
is a matter, as I have previously said, of daily 
observation.&nbsp; Whether <!-- page 234--><a 
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>we regard a
juggler, a pianist, or a billiard-player, a child learning his 
lesson or an actor his part by frequently repeating it, or a 
thousand other illustrations of the same process, we see at once 
that there is truth in the cynical definition of a man as a 
&lsquo;bundle of habits.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the same of course is 
true of animals.&rdquo; <a name="citation234a"></a><a 
href="#footnote234a" class="citation">[234a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this Mr. Romanes goes on to show &ldquo;that automatic 
actions and conscious habits may be inherited,&rdquo; <a 
name="citation234b"></a><a href="#footnote234b" 
class="citation">[234b]</a> and in the course of doing this 
contends that &ldquo;instincts may be lost by disuse, and 
conversely that they may be acquired as instincts by the 
hereditary transmission of ancestral experience.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation234c"></a><a href="#footnote234c" 
class="citation">[234c]</a></p>
<p>On another page Mr. Romanes says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let us now turn to the second of these two 
assumptions, viz., that some at least among migratory birds must 
possess, by inheritance alone, a very precise knowledge of the 
particular direction to be pursued.&nbsp; It is without question 
an astonishing fact that a young cuckoo should be prompted to 
leave its foster parents at a particular season of the year, and 
without any guide to show the course previously taken by its own 
parents, but this is a fact which must be met by any theory of 
instinct which aims at being complete.&nbsp; Now upon our own 
theory it can only be met by taking it to be due to inherited 
memory.&rdquo; <a name="citation234d"></a><a href="#footnote234d"
class="citation">[234d]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Romanes says in a note that this theory was first advanced
by Canon Kingsley in <i>Nature</i>, January 18, 1867, a piece of 
information which I learn for the first time; otherwise, as I 
need hardly say, I should have called attention to it in my own 
books on evolution.&nbsp; <i>Nature</i> did not begin to appear 
till the end of 1869, and I can find no communication from Canon 
<!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
235</span>Kingsley bearing upon hereditary memory in any number 
of <i>Nature</i> prior to the date of Canon Kingsley&rsquo;s 
death; but no doubt Mr. Romanes has only made a slip in his 
reference.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes also says that the theory connecting
instinct with inherited memory &ldquo;has since been 
independently &lsquo;suggested&rsquo; by many writers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little lower Mr. Romanes says: &ldquo;Of what kind, then, is
the inherited memory on which the young cuckoo (if not also other
migratory birds) depends?&nbsp; We can only answer, of the same 
kind, whatever this may be, as that upon which the old bird 
depends.&rdquo; <a name="citation235"></a><a href="#footnote235" 
class="citation">[235]</a></p>
<p>I have given above most of the more marked passages which I 
have been able to find in Mr. Romanes&rsquo; book which attribute
instinct to memory, and which admit that there is no fundamental 
difference between the kind of memory with which we are all 
familiar and hereditary memory as transmitted from one generation
to another.&nbsp; But throughout his work there are passages 
which suggest, though less obviously, the same inference.</p>
<p>The passages I have quoted show that Mr. Romanes is upholding 
the same opinions as Professor Hering&rsquo;s and my own, but 
their effect and tendency is more plain here than in Mr. 
Romanes&rsquo; own book, where they are overlaid by nearly 400 
long pages of matter which is not always easy of 
comprehension.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Darwin himself, indeed&mdash;whose mantle seems 
to have fallen more especially and particularly on Mr. 
Romanes&mdash;could not contradict himself more hopelessly than 
Mr. Romanes often does.&nbsp; Indeed in one of the very passages 
I have quoted in order to show that Mr. Romanes accepts the 
phenomena of heredity as <!-- page 236--><a 
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>phenomena 
of memory, he speaks of &ldquo;heredity as playing an important 
part <i>in forming memory</i> of ancestral experiences;&rdquo; so
that whereas I want him to say that the phenomena of heredity are
due to memory, he will have it that the memory is due to the 
heredity, <a name="citation236a"></a><a href="#footnote236a" 
class="citation">[236a]</a> which seems to me absurd.</p>
<p>Over and over again Mr. Romanes insists that it is heredity 
which does this or that.&nbsp; Thus it is &ldquo;<i>heredity with
natural selection which adapt</i> the anatomical plan of the 
ganglia.&rdquo; <a name="citation236b"></a><a 
href="#footnote236b" class="citation">[236b]</a>&nbsp; It is 
heredity which impresses nervous changes on the individual. <a 
name="citation236c"></a><a href="#footnote236c" 
class="citation">[236c]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;In the lifetime of 
species actions originally intelligent may by frequent repetition
<i>and heredity</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c. <a name="citation236d"></a><a
href="#footnote236d" class="citation">[236d]</a>; but he nowhere 
tells us what heredity is any more than Messrs. Herbert Spencer, 
Darwin, and Lewes have done.&nbsp; This, however, is, exactly 
what Professor Hering, whom I have unwittingly followed, 
does.&nbsp; He resolves all phenomena of heredity, whether in 
respect of body or mind, into phenomena of memory.&nbsp; He says 
in effect, &ldquo;A man grows his body as he does, and a bird 
makes her nest as she does, because both man and bird remember 
having grown body and made nest as they now do, or very nearly 
so, on innumerable past occasions.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thus reduces 
life from an equation of say 100 unknown quantities to one of 99 
only by showing that heredity and memory, two of the original 100
unknown quantities, are in reality part of one and the same 
thing.</p>
<p>That he is right Mr. Romanes seems to me to admit, though in a
very unsatisfactory way.</p>
<h2><!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>REMARKS ON MR. ROMANES&rsquo; MENTAL
EVOLUTION IN ANIMALS&mdash;(<i>continued</i>).</h2>
<p>I will give examples of my meaning.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes says on 
an early page, &ldquo;The most fundamental principle of mental 
operation is that of memory, for this is the <i>conditio sine 
qu&acirc; non</i> of all mental life&rdquo; (page 35).</p>
<p>I do not understand Mr. Romanes to hold that there is any 
living being which has no mind at all, and I do understand him to
admit that development of body and mind are closely 
interdependent.</p>
<p>If then, &ldquo;the most fundamental principle&rdquo; of mind 
is memory, it follows that memory enters also as a fundamental 
principle into development of body.&nbsp; For mind and body are 
so closely connected that nothing can enter largely into the one 
without correspondingly affecting the other.</p>
<p>On a later page, indeed, Mr. Romanes speaks point-blank of the
new-born child as &ldquo;<i>embodying</i> the results of a great 
mass of <i>hereditary experience</i>&rdquo; (p. 77), so that what
he is driving at can be collected by those who take trouble, but 
is not seen until we call up from our own knowledge matter whose 
relevancy does not appear on the face of it, and until we connect
passages many pages asunder, the first of which may easily be 
forgotten before we reach the second.&nbsp; There can be no 
doubt, however, that Mr. Romanes does in reality, <!-- page 
238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
238</span>like Professor Hering and myself, regard development, 
whether of mind or body, as due to memory, for it is nonsense 
indeed to talk about &ldquo;hereditary experience&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;hereditary memory&rdquo; if anything else is intended.</p>
<p>I have said above that on page 113 of his recent work Mr. 
Romanes declares the analogies between the memory with which we 
are familiar in daily life, and hereditary memory, to be 
&ldquo;so numerous and precise&rdquo; as to justify us in 
considering them as of one and the same kind.</p>
<p>This is certainly his meaning, but, with the exception of the 
words within inverted commas, it is not his language.&nbsp; His 
own words are these:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Profound, however, as our ignorance 
unquestionably is concerning the physical substratum of memory, I
think we are at least justified in regarding this substratum as 
the same both in ganglionic or organic, and in conscious or 
psychological memory, seeing that the analogies between them are 
so numerous and precise.&nbsp; Consciousness is but an adjunct 
which arises when the physical processes, owing to infrequency of
repetition, complexity of operation, or other causes, involve 
what I have before called ganglionic friction.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I submit that I have correctly translated Mr. Romanes&rsquo; 
meaning, and also that we have a right to complain of his not 
saying what he has to say in words which will involve less 
&ldquo;ganglionic friction&rdquo; on the part of the reader.</p>
<p>Another example may be found on p. 43 of Mr. Romanes&rsquo; 
book.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lastly,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;just as 
innumerable special mechanisms of muscular co-ordinations are 
found to be inherited, innumerable special associations of ideas 
are found to be the same, and in one <!-- page 239--><a 
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>case as in 
the other the strength of the organically imposed connection is 
found to bear a direct proportion to the frequency with which in 
the history of the species it has occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes is here intending what the reader will find 
insisted on on p. 98 of the present volume; but how difficult he 
has made what could have been said intelligibly enough, if there 
had been nothing but the reader&rsquo;s comfort to be 
considered.&nbsp; Unfortunately that seems to have been by no 
means the only thing of which Mr. Romanes was thinking, or why, 
after implying and even saying over and over again that instinct 
is inherited habit due to inherited memory, should he turn 
sharply round on p. 297 and praise Mr. Darwin for trying to snuff
out &ldquo;the well-known doctrine of inherited habit as advanced
by Lamarck&rdquo;?&nbsp; The answer is not far to seek.&nbsp; It 
is because Mr. Romanes did not merely want to tell us all about 
instinct, but wanted also, if I may use a homely metaphor, to 
hunt with the hounds and run with the hare at one and the same 
time.</p>
<p>I remember saying that if the late Mr. Darwin &ldquo;had told 
us what the earlier evolutionists said, why they said it, wherein
he differed from them, and in what way he proposed to set them 
straight, he would have taken a course at once more agreeable 
with usual practice, and more likely to remove misconception from
his own mind and from those of his readers.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation239"></a><a href="#footnote239" 
class="citation">[239]</a>&nbsp; This I have no doubt was one of 
the passages which made Mr. Romanes so angry with me.&nbsp; I can
find no better words to apply to Mr. Romanes himself.&nbsp; He 
knows perfectly well what others have written about the 
connection between heredity and memory, and he knows <!-- page 
240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>no
less well that so far as he is intelligible at all he is taking 
the same view that they have taken.&nbsp; If he had begun by 
saying what they had said and had then improved on it, I for one 
should have been only too glad to be improved upon.</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes has spoiled his book just because this plain 
old-fashioned method of procedure was not good enough for 
him.&nbsp; One-half the obscurity which makes his meaning so hard
to apprehend is due to exactly the same cause as that which has 
ruined so much of the late Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s work&mdash;I mean 
to a desire to appear to be differing altogether from others with
whom he knew himself after all to be in substantial 
agreement.&nbsp; He adopts, but (probably quite unconsciously) in
his anxiety to avoid appearing to adopt, he obscures what he is 
adopting.</p>
<p>Here, for example, is Mr. Romanes&rsquo; definition of 
instinct:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Instinct is reflex action into which there 
is imported the element of consciousness.&nbsp; The term is 
therefore a generic one, comprising all those faculties of mind 
which are concerned in conscious and adaptive action, antecedent 
to individual experience, without necessary knowledge of the 
relation between means employed and ends attained, but similarly 
performed under similar and frequently recurring circumstances by
all the individuals of the same species.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation240"></a><a href="#footnote240" 
class="citation">[240]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Mr. Romanes would have been content to build frankly upon 
Professor Hering&rsquo;s foundation, the soundness of which he 
has elsewhere abundantly admitted, he might have said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct is knowledge or habit acquired in past 
generations&mdash;the new generation remembering what <!-- page 
241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
241</span>happened to it before it parted company with the 
old.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he might have added as a rider&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a habit is acquired as a new one, during any given 
lifetime, it is not an instinct.&nbsp; If having been acquired in
one lifetime it is transmitted to offspring, it is an instinct in
the offspring though it was not an instinct in the parent.&nbsp; 
If the habit is transmitted partially, it must be considered as 
partly instinctive and partly acquired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is easy; it tells people how they may test any action so 
as to know what they ought to call it; it leaves well alone by 
avoiding all such debatable matters as reflex action, 
consciousness, intelligence, purpose, knowledge of purpose, 
&amp;c.; it both introduces the feature of inheritance which is 
the one mainly distinguishing instinctive from so-called 
intelligent actions, and shows the manner in which these last 
pass into the first, that is to say, by way of memory and 
habitual repetition; finally it points the fact that the new 
generation is not to be looked upon as a new thing, but (as Dr. 
Erasmus Darwin long since said <a name="citation241"></a><a 
href="#footnote241" class="citation">[241]</a>) as &ldquo;a 
branch or elongation&rdquo; of the one immediately preceding 
it.</p>
<p>But then to have said this would have made it too plain that 
Mr. Romanes was following some one else.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes should
remember that no one would mind how much he took if he would only
take it well.&nbsp; But this is what those who take without due 
acknowledgment never do.</p>
<p>In Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s case it is hardly possible to exaggerate
the waste of time, money, and trouble that has been caused by his
not having been content to appear as descending with modification
like other people from those who went before him.&nbsp; It will 
take years to get <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>the evolution theory out of the mess
in which Mr. Darwin has left it.&nbsp; He was heir to a 
discredited truth; he left behind him an accredited 
fallacy.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes, if he is not stopped in time, will 
get the theory connecting heredity and memory into just such 
another muddle as Mr. Darwin has got Evolution, for surely the 
writer who can talk about &ldquo;<i>heredity being able to work 
up</i> the faculty of homing into the instinct of 
migration,&rdquo; <a name="citation242a"></a><a 
href="#footnote242a" class="citation">[242a]</a> or of &ldquo;the
principle of (natural) selection combining with that of lapsing 
intelligence to the formation of a joint result,&rdquo; <a 
name="citation242b"></a><a href="#footnote242b" 
class="citation">[242b]</a> is little likely to depart from the 
usual methods of scientific procedure with advantage either to 
himself or any one else.&nbsp; Fortunately Mr. Romanes is not Mr.
Darwin, and though he has certainly got Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s 
mantle, and got it very much too, it will not on Mr. 
Romanes&rsquo; shoulders hide a good deal that people were not 
going to observe too closely while Mr. Darwin wore it.</p>
<h2><!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>REMARKS ON MR. ROMANES&rsquo; MENTAL
EVOLUTION IN ANIMALS&mdash;(<i>concluded</i>).</h2>
<p>I gather that in the end the late Mr. Darwin himself admitted 
the soundness of the view which the reader will have found 
insisted upon in the extracts from my earlier books given in this
volume.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes quotes a letter written by Mr. Darwin 
in the last year of his life, in which he speaks of an 
intelligent action gradually becoming &ldquo;<i>instinctive</i>, 
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>memory transmitted from one generation to 
another</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation243a"></a><a 
href="#footnote243a" class="citation">[243a]</a></p>
<p>Briefly, the stages of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s opinion upon the 
subject of hereditary memory are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1859.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be <i>the most serious error</i> 
to suppose that the greater number of instincts have been 
acquired by habit in one generation and transmitted by 
inheritance to succeeding generations.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation243b"></a><a href="#footnote243b" 
class="citation">[243b]</a>&nbsp; And this more especially 
applies to the instincts of many ants.</p>
<p>1876.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be <i>a serious error</i> to 
suppose&rdquo; &amp;c., as before. <a name="citation243c"></a><a 
href="#footnote243c" class="citation">[243c]</a></p>
<p>1881.&nbsp; &ldquo;We should remember <i>what a mass of 
inherited knowledge</i> is crowded into the minute brain of a 
worker ant.&rdquo; <a name="citation243d"></a><a 
href="#footnote243d" class="citation">[243d]</a></p>
<p>1881 or 1882.&nbsp; Speaking of a given habitual action <!-- 
page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
244</span>Mr. Darwin writes:&mdash;&ldquo;It does not seem to me 
at all incredible that this action [and why this more than any 
other habitual action?] should then become instinctive:&rdquo; 
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>memory transmitted from one generation to 
another</i>. <a name="citation244a"></a><a href="#footnote244a" 
class="citation">[244a]</a></p>
<p>And yet in 1839 or thereabouts, Mr. Darwin had pretty nearly 
grasped the conception from which until the last year or two of 
his life he so fatally strayed; for in his contribution to the 
volumes giving an account of the voyages of the <i>Adventure</i> 
and <i>Beagle</i>, he wrote: &ldquo;Nature by making habit 
omnipotent and its effects hereditary, has fitted the Fuegian for
the climate and productions of his country&rdquo; (p. 237).</p>
<p>What is the secret of the long departure from the simple 
common-sense view of the matter which he took when he was a young
man?&nbsp; I imagine simply what I have referred to in the 
preceding chapter,&mdash;over-anxiety to appear to be differing 
from his grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck.</p>
<p>I believe I may say that Mr. Darwin before he died not only 
admitted the connection between memory and heredity, but came 
also to see that he must readmit that design in organism which he
had so many years opposed.&nbsp; For in the preface to Hermann 
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Fertilisation of Flowers, <a 
name="citation244b"></a><a href="#footnote244b" 
class="citation">[244b]</a> which bears a date only a very few 
weeks prior to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s death, I find him 
saying:&mdash;&ldquo;Design in nature has for a long time deeply 
interested many men, and though the subject must now be looked at
from a somewhat different point of view from what was formerly 
the case, it is not on that account rendered less 
interesting.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is mused <!-- page 245--><a 
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>forth as a 
general gnome, and may mean anything or nothing: the writer of 
the letterpress under the hieroglyph in Old Moore&rsquo;s Almanac
could not be more guarded; but I think I know what it does 
mean.</p>
<p>I cannot of course be sure; Mr. Darwin did not probably intend
that I should; but I assume with confidence that whether there is
design in organism or no, there is at any rate design in this 
passage of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This, we may be sure, is not
a fortuitous variation; and moreover it is introduced for some 
reason which made Mr. Darwin think it worth while to go out of 
his way to introduce it.&nbsp; It has no fitness in its 
connection with Hermann M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s book, for what little
Hermann M&uuml;ller says about teleology at all is to condemn it;
why then should Mr. Darwin muse here of all places in the world 
about the interest attaching to design in organism?&nbsp; Neither
has the passage any connection with the rest of the 
preface.&nbsp; There is not another word about design, and even 
here Mr. Darwin seems mainly anxious to face both ways, and pat 
design as it were on the head while not committing himself to any
proposition which could be disputed.</p>
<p>The explanation is sufficiently obvious.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin 
wanted to hedge.&nbsp; He saw that the design which his works had
been mainly instrumental in pitchforking out of organisms no less
manifestly designed than a burglar&rsquo;s jemmy is designed, had
nevertheless found its way back again, and that though, as I 
insisted in Evolution, Old and New, and Unconscious Memory, it 
must now be placed within the organism instead of outside it, as 
&ldquo;was formerly the case,&rdquo; it was not on that account 
any the less&mdash;design, as well as interesting.</p>
<p>I should like to have seen Mr. Darwin say this more 
explicitly.&nbsp; Indeed I should have liked to have seen <!-- 
page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
246</span>Mr. Darwin say anything at all about the meaning of 
which there could be no mistake, and without contradicting 
himself elsewhere; but this was not Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s 
manner.</p>
<p>In passing I will give another example of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s 
manner when he did not quite dare even to hedge.&nbsp; It is to 
be found in the preface which he wrote to Professor 
Weismann&rsquo;s Studies in the Theory of Descent, published in 
1882.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several distinguished naturalists,&rdquo; says Mr. 
Darwin, &ldquo;maintain with much confidence that organic beings 
tend to vary and to rise in the scale, independently of the 
conditions to which they and their progenitors have been exposed;
whilst others maintain that all variation is due to such 
exposure, though the manner in which the environment acts is as 
yet quite unknown.&nbsp; At the present time there is hardly any 
question in biology of more importance than this of the nature 
and causes of variability, and the reader will find in the 
present work an able discussion on the whole subject which will 
probably lead him to pause before he admits the existence of an 
innate tendency to perfectibility&rdquo;&mdash;or towards, 
<i>being able to be perfected</i>.</p>
<p>I could find no able discussion upon the whole subject in 
Professor Weismann&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; There was a little 
something here and there, but not much.</p>
<p>Mr Herbert Spencer has not in his more recent works said 
anything which enables me to appeal to his authority.</p>
<p>I imagine that if he had got hold of the idea that heredity 
was only a mode of memory before 1870, when he published the 
second edition of his Principles of Psychology, he would have 
gladly adopted it, for he seems continually groping after it, and
aware of it as <!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>near him, though he is never able to
grasp it.&nbsp; He probably failed to grasp it because Lamarck 
had failed.&nbsp; He could not adopt it in his edition of 1880, 
for this is evidently printed from stereos taken from the 1870 
edition, and no considerable alteration was therefore 
possible.</p>
<p>The late Mr. G. H. Lewes did not get hold of the memory 
theory, probably because neither Mr. Spencer nor any of the 
well-known German philosophers had done so.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes, as
I think I have shown, actually has adopted it, but he does not 
say where he got it from.&nbsp; I suppose from reading Canon 
Kingsley in <i>Nature</i> some years before <i>Nature</i> began 
to exist, or (for has not the mantle of Mr. Darwin fallen upon 
him?) he has thought it all out independently; but however Mr. 
Romanes may have reached his conclusion, he must have done so 
comparatively recently, for when he reviewed my book, Unconscious
Memory, <a name="citation247"></a><a href="#footnote247" 
class="citation">[247]</a> he scoffed at the very theory which he
is now adopting.</p>
<p>Of the view that &ldquo;there is thus a race memory, as there 
is an individual memory, and that the expression of the former 
constitutes the phenomena of heredity&rdquo;&mdash;for it is thus
Mr. Romanes with fair accuracy describes the theory I was 
supporting&mdash;he wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this view, in which Mr. Butler was anticipated by 
Prof. Hering, is interesting if advanced merely as an 
illustration; but to imagine that it maintains any truth of 
profound significance, or that it can possibly be fraught with 
any benefit to science, is simply absurd.&nbsp; The most cursory 
thought is enough to show,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can understand,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;in some 
measure how an alteration in brain structure when once <!-- page 
248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
248</span>made should be permanent, . . . but we cannot 
understand how this alteration is transmitted to progeny through 
structures so unlike the brain as are the products of the 
generative glands.&nbsp; And we merely stultify ourselves if we 
suppose that the problem is brought any nearer to a solution by 
asserting that a future individual while still in the germ has 
already participated, say in the cerebral alterations of its 
parents,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes could find no measure 
of abuse strong enough for me,&mdash;as any reader may see who 
feels curious enough to turn to Mr. Romanes&rsquo; article in 
<i>Nature</i> already referred to.</p>
<p>As for Evolution, Old and New, he said I had written it 
&ldquo;in the hope of gaining some notoriety by deserving and 
perhaps receiving a contemptuous refutation from&rdquo; Mr. 
Darwin. <a name="citation248a"></a><a href="#footnote248a" 
class="citation">[248a]</a>&nbsp; In my reply to Mr. Romanes I 
said, &ldquo;I will not characterise this accusation in the terms
which it merits.&rdquo; <a name="citation248b"></a><a 
href="#footnote248b" class="citation">[248b]</a>&nbsp; Mr. 
Romanes, in the following number of <i>Nature</i>, withdrew his 
accusation and immediately added, &ldquo;I was induced to advance
it because it seemed the only rational motive that could have led
to the publication of such a book.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again I will not 
characterise such a withdrawal in the terms it merits, but I may 
say in passing that if Mr. Romanes thinks the motive he assigned 
to me &ldquo;a rational one,&rdquo; his view of what is rational 
and mine differ.&nbsp; It does not commend itself as 
&ldquo;rational&rdquo; to me, that a man should spend a good deal
of money and two or three years of work in the hope of deserving 
a contemptuous refutation from any one&mdash;not even from Mr. 
Darwin.&nbsp; But then Mr. Romanes has written such a lot about 
reason and intelligence.</p>
<p>The reply to Evolution, Old and New, which I actually <!-- 
page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
249</span>did get from Mr. Darwin, was one which I do not see 
advertised among Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s other works now, and which I 
venture to say never will be advertised among them 
again&mdash;not at least until it has been altered.&nbsp; I have 
seen no reason to leave off advertising Evolution, Old and New, 
and Unconscious Memory.</p>
<p>I have never that I know of seen Mr. Romanes, but am told that
he is still young.&nbsp; I can find no publication of his indexed
in the British Museum Catalogue earlier than 1874, and then it 
was only about Christian Prayer.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes was good 
enough to advise me to turn painter or hom&oelig;opathist; <a 
name="citation249"></a><a href="#footnote249" 
class="citation">[249]</a> as he has introduced the subject, and 
considering how many years I am his senior, I might be justified 
(if it could be any pleasure to me to do so) in suggesting to him
too what I should imagine most likely to tend to his advancement 
in life; but there are examples so bad that even those who have 
no wish to be any better than their neighbours may yet decline to
follow them, and I think Mr. Romanes&rsquo; is one of 
these.&nbsp; I will not therefore find him a profession.</p>
<p>But leaving this matter on one side, the point I wish to 
insist on is that Mr. Romanes is saying almost in my own words 
what less than three years ago he was very angry with me for 
saying.&nbsp; I do not think that under these circumstances much 
explanation is necessary as to the reasons which have led Mr. 
Romanes to fight so shy of any reference to Life and Habit, 
Evolution, Old and New, and Unconscious Memory&mdash;works in 
which, if I may venture to say so, the theory connecting the 
phenomena of heredity with memory has been not only 
&ldquo;suggested,&rdquo; but so far established that even Mr. 
Romanes has been led to think the matter over independently <!-- 
page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
250</span>and to arrive at the same general conclusion as 
myself.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, Mr. Grant Allen too has come to much the 
same conclusions as myself, after having attacked me, though not 
so fiercely, as Mr. Romanes has done.&nbsp; In 1879 he said in 
the <i>Examiner</i> (May 17) that the teleological view put 
forward in Evolution, Old and New, was &ldquo;just the sort of 
mystical nonsense from which&rdquo; he &ldquo;had hoped Mr. 
Darwin had for ever saved us.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so in the 
<i>Academy</i> on the same day he said that no &ldquo;one-sided 
argument&rdquo; (referring to Evolution, Old and New) could ever 
deprive Mr. Darwin of the &ldquo;place which he had eternally won
in the history of human thought by his magnificent 
achievement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few years, and Mr. Allen entertains a very different opinion
of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s magnificent achievement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only two conceivable ways,&rdquo; he writes, 
&ldquo;in which any increment of brain power can ever have arisen
in any individual.&nbsp; The one is the Darwinian way, by 
&lsquo;spontaneous variation,&rsquo; that is to say by variation 
due to minute physical circumstances affecting the individual in 
the germ.&nbsp; The other is the Spencerian way, by functional 
increment, that is to say by the effect of increased use and 
constant exposure to varying circumstances during conscious 
life.&rdquo; <a name="citation250"></a><a href="#footnote250" 
class="citation">[250]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Allen must know very well, or if he does not he has no 
excuse at any rate for not knowing, that the theory according to 
which increase of brain power or any other bodily or mental power
is due to use, is no more Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s than the theory of 
gravitation is, except in so far as that Mr. Spencer has adopted 
it.&nbsp; It is the theory which every one except Mr. Allen <!-- 
page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
251</span>associates with Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck, but more 
especially (and on the whole I suppose justly) with Lamarck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I venture to think,&rdquo; continues Mr. Allen, 
&ldquo;that the first way [Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s], if we look it 
clearly in the face, will be seen to be <i>practically 
unthinkable</i>; and that we have therefore no alternative but to
accept the second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These writers go round so quickly and so completely that there
is no keeping pace with them.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to 
Materialism,&rdquo; he writes presently, &ldquo;surely it is more
profoundly materialistic to suppose that mere physical causes 
operating on the germ can determine minute physical and material 
changes in the brain, which will in turn make the individuality 
what it is to be, than to suppose <i>that all brains are what 
they are in virtue of antecedent function</i>.&nbsp; The one 
creed makes the man depend mainly upon the accidents of molecular
physics in a colliding germ cell and sperm cell; <i>the other 
makes him depend mainly upon the doings and gains of his 
ancestors as modified and altered by himself</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is a sentence taken almost at random from the body of the
article:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are always seeing something which adds 
to our total stock of memories; we are always learning and doing 
something new.&nbsp; The vast majority of these experiences are 
similar in kind to those already passed through by our ancestors:
they add nothing to the inheritance of the race. . . . Though 
they leave physical traces on the individual, they do not so far 
affect the underlying organisation of the brain as to make the 
development of after-brains somewhat different from previous 
ones.&nbsp; But there are certain functional activities which do 
tend so to alter the development of <!-- page 252--><a 
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
252</span>after-brains; certain novel or sustained activities 
which apparently result in the production of new correlated brain
elements or brain connections hereditarily transmissible as 
increased potentialities of similar activity in the 
offspring.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of Natural Selection Mr. Allen writes much, as Professor 
Mivart and others have been writing for many years past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;easy to 
understand how survival of the fittest may result in progress 
starting from such functionally produced gains, but impossible to
understand how it could result in progress if it had to start in 
mere accidental structural increments due to spontaneous 
variation alone.&rdquo; <a name="citation252a"></a><a 
href="#footnote252a" class="citation">[252a]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Allen may say this now, but until lately he has been among
the first to scold any one else who said so.</p>
<p>And this is how the article concludes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first hypothesis (Mr Darwin&rsquo;s) is one that 
throws no light upon any of the facts.&nbsp; The second 
hypothesis (which Mr. Allen is pleased to call Mr. Herbert 
Spencer&rsquo;s) is one that explains them all with transparent 
lucidity.&rdquo; <a name="citation252b"></a><a 
href="#footnote252b" class="citation">[252b]</a></p>
<p>So that Mr. Darwin, according to Mr. Allen, is clean out of 
it.&nbsp; Truly when Mr. Allen makes stepping-stones of his dead 
selves, he jumps upon them to some tune.&nbsp; But then Mr. 
Darwin is dead now.&nbsp; I have not heard of his having given 
Mr. Allen any manuscripts as he gave Mr. Romanes.&nbsp; I hope 
Mr. Herbert Spencer will not give him any.&nbsp; If I was Mr. 
Spencer and found my admirers crowning me with Lamarck&rsquo;s 
laurels, I think I should have something to say to them.</p>
<p><!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>What are we to think of a writer who declares that the 
theory that specific and generic changes are due to use and 
disuse &ldquo;explains <i>all the facts</i> with transparent 
lucidity&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Lamarck&rsquo;s hypothesis is no doubt a great help and a 
great step toward Professor Hering&rsquo;s; it makes a known 
cause underlie variations, and thus is free from those fatal 
objections which Professor Mivart and others have brought against
the theory of Messrs. Darwin and Wallace; but how does the theory
that use develops an organism explain why offspring repeat the 
organism at all?&nbsp; How does the Lamarckian hypothesis explain
the sterility of hybrids, for example?&nbsp; The sterility of 
hybrids has been always considered one of the great <i>cruces</i>
in connection with any theory of Evolution.&nbsp; How again does 
it explain reversion to long-lost characters and the resumption 
of feral characteristics? the phenomena of old age? the principle
that underlies longevity? the reason why the reproductive system 
is generally the last to arrive at maturity, and why few further 
developments take place in any organism after this has been fully
developed? the sterility of many animals under captivity? the 
development in both males and females, under certain 
circumstances, of the characteristics of the opposite sex? the 
latency of memory? the unconsciousness with which we develop, and
with which instinctive actions are performed?&nbsp; How does any 
theory advanced either by Lamarck, Mr. Herbert Spencer, or Mr. 
Darwin explain, or indeed throw light upon these facts until 
supplemented with the explanation given of them in Life and 
Habit&mdash;for which I must refer the reader to that work 
itself?</p>
<p>People may say what they like about &ldquo;the experience <!--
page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
254</span>of the race,&rdquo; <a name="citation254a"></a><a 
href="#footnote254a" class="citation">[254a]</a> &ldquo;the 
registration of experiences continued for numberless 
generations,&rdquo; <a name="citation254b"></a><a 
href="#footnote254b" class="citation">[254b]</a> &ldquo;infinity 
of experiences,&rdquo; <a name="citation254c"></a><a 
href="#footnote254c" class="citation">[254c]</a> &ldquo;lapsed 
intelligence,&rdquo; &amp;c., but until they make Memory, in the 
most uncompromising sense of the word, the key to all the 
phenomena of Heredity, they will get little help to the better 
understanding of the difficulties above adverted to.&nbsp; Add 
this to the theory of Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck, and 
the points which I have above alluded to receive a good deal of 
&ldquo;lucidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to return to Mr. Romanes: however much he and Mr. Allen 
may differ about the merits of Mr. Darwin, they were at any rate 
not long since cordially agreed in vilipending my unhappy self, 
and are now saying very much what I have been saying for some 
years past.&nbsp; I do not deny that they are capable 
witnesses.&nbsp; They will generally see a thing when a certain 
number of other people have come to do so.&nbsp; I submit that, 
no matter how grudgingly they give their evidence, the tendency 
of that evidence is sufficiently clear to show that the opinions 
put forward in Life and Habit, Evolution, Old and New, and 
Unconscious Memory, deserve the attention of the reader.</p>
<p>I may perhaps deal with Mr. Romanes&rsquo; recent work more 
fully in the sequel to Life and Habit on which I am now 
engaged.&nbsp; For the present it is enough to say that if he 
does not mean what Professor Hering and, <i>longo intervallo</i>,
myself do, he should not talk about habit or experience as 
between successive generations, and that if he does mean what we 
do&mdash;which I suppose he does&mdash;he should have said so 
much more clearly and consistently than he has.</p>
<h3><!-- page 254a--><a name="page254a"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 254a</span>POSTSCRIPT.</h3>
<p>This afternoon (March 7, 1884), the copies of this book being 
ready for issue, I see Mr. Romanes&rsquo; letter to the 
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> of this day, and get this postscript pasted
into the book after binding.</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes corrects his reference to the passage in which he 
says that Canon Kingsley first advanced the theory that instinct 
is inherited memory (&ldquo;M. E. in Animals,&rdquo; p. 
296).&nbsp; Canon Kingsley&rsquo;s words are to be found in 
<i>Fraser</i>, June, 1867, and are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yon wood-wren has had enough to make him 
sad, if only he recollects it, and if he can recollect his road 
from Morocco hither he maybe recollects likewise what happened on
the road: the long weary journey up the Portuguese coast, and 
through the gap between the Pyrenees and the Jaysquivel, and up 
the Landes of Bordeaux, and through Brittany, flitting by night 
and hiding and feeding as he could by day; and how his mates flew
against the lighthouses and were killed by hundreds, and how he 
essayed the British Channel and was blown back, shrivelled up by 
bitter blasts; and how he felt, nevertheless, that &lsquo;that 
was water he must cross,&rsquo; he knew not why; but something 
told him that his mother had done it before him, and he was flesh
of her flesh, life of her life, and had inherited her instinct 
(as we call hereditary memory in order to avoid the trouble of 
finding out what it is and how it comes).&nbsp; A duty was laid 
on him to go back to the place where he was bred, and now it is 
done, and he is weary and sad and lonely, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very interesting passage, and I am glad to quote it;
but it hardly amounts to advancing the theory <!-- page 254b--><a
name="page254b"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254b</span>that 
instinct is inherited memory.&nbsp; Observing Mr. Romanes&rsquo; 
words closely, I see he only says that Canon Kingsley was the 
first to advance the theory &ldquo;that many hundred miles of 
landscape scenery&rdquo; can &ldquo;constitute an object of 
inherited memory;&rdquo; but as he proceeds to say that 
&ldquo;<i>this</i>&rdquo; has since &ldquo;been independently 
suggested by several writers,&rdquo; it is plain he intends to 
convey the idea that Canon Kingsley advanced the theory that 
instinct generally is inherited memory, which indeed his words 
do; but it is hardly credible that he should have left them where
he did if he had realized their importance.</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes proceeds to inform me personally that the 
reference to &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; in his proof &ldquo;originally 
indicated another writer who had independently advanced the same 
theory as that of Canon Kingsley.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this I have 
a right to ask him to tell me who the writer is, and where I 
shall find what he said.&nbsp; I ask this, and at my earliest 
opportunity will do my best to give this writer, too, the credit 
he doubtless deserves.</p>
<p>I have never professed to be the originator of the theory 
connecting heredity with memory.&nbsp; I knew I knew so little 
that I was in great trepidation when I wrote all the earlier 
chapters of &ldquo;Life and Habit.&rdquo;&nbsp; I put them 
paradoxically, because I did not dare to put them 
otherwise.&nbsp; As the book went on, I saw I was on firm ground,
and the paradox was dropped.&nbsp; When I found what Professor 
Hering had done, I put him forward as best I could at once.&nbsp;
I then learned German, and translated him, giving his words in 
full in &ldquo;Unconscious Memory;&rdquo; since then I have 
always spoken of the theory as Professor Hering&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes says that &ldquo;the theory in question forms the 
backbone of all the previous literature <!-- page 254c--><a 
name="page254c"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254c</span>on 
instinct by the above-named writers (not to mention their 
numerous followers) and is by all of them elaborately stated as 
clearly as any theory can be stated in words.&rdquo;&nbsp; Few 
except Mr. Romanes will say this.&nbsp; I grant it ought to have 
formed the backbone &ldquo;of all previous literature on instinct
by the above-named writers,&rdquo; but when I wrote &ldquo;Life 
and Habit&rdquo; it was not understood to form it.&nbsp; If it 
had been, I should not have found it necessary to come before the
public this fourth time during the last seven years to insist 
upon it.&nbsp; Of course the theory is not new&mdash;it was in 
the air and bound to come; but when it came, it came through 
Professor Hering of Prague, and not through those who, great as 
are the services they have rendered, still did not render this 
particular one of making memory the keystone of their 
system.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes now says: &ldquo;Why, of course, 
that&rsquo;s what they were meaning all the time.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Perhaps they were, but they did not say so, and 
others&mdash;conspicuously Mr. Romanes himself&mdash;did not 
understand them to be meaning what he now discovers that they 
meant.&nbsp; When Mr. Romanes attacked me in <i>Nature</i>, 
January 27, 1881, he said I had &ldquo;been anticipated by 
Professor Hering,&rdquo; but he evidently did not understand that
any one else had anticipated me; and far from holding, as he now 
does, that &ldquo;the theory in question forms the backbone of 
all the previous&rdquo; writers on instinct, and &ldquo;is by all
of them elaborately stated as clearly as any theory can be stated
in words,&rdquo; he said (in a passage already quoted) that it 
was &ldquo;interesting, if advanced merely as an illustration, 
but to imagine that it maintains any truth of profound 
significance, or that it can possibly be fraught with any benefit
to science, is absurd.&rdquo;&nbsp; Considering how recently Mr. 
<!-- page 254d--><a name="page254d"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
254d</span>Romanes wrote the words just quoted, he has soon 
forgotten them.</p>
<p>I do not, as I have said already, and never did, claim to have
originated the theory I put forward in &ldquo;Life and 
Habit.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought it out independently, but I knew it
must have occurred to many, and had probably been worked out by 
many, before myself.&nbsp; My claim is to have brought it perhaps
into fuller light, and to have dwelt on its importance, bearings,
and developments with some persistence, and to have done so 
without much recognition or encouragement, till lately.&nbsp; Of 
men of science, Mr. A. R. Wallace and Professor Mivart gave me 
encouragement, but no one else has done so.&nbsp; I sometimes 
saw, as in the Duke of Argyll&rsquo;s case, and in Mr. 
Romanes&rsquo; own, that men were writing at me, or borrowing 
from me, but with the two exceptions already made, and that also 
of the Bishop of Carlisle, not one of the literary and scientific
notables of the day so much as mentioned my name while making use
of my work.</p>
<p>A few words more, and I will bring these remarks to a close, 
Mr. Romanes says I represent &ldquo;the phenomena of memory as 
occurring throughout the inorganic world.&rdquo;&nbsp; This 
implies that I attribute all the phenomena of memory as we see 
them in animals to such things as stones and gases.&nbsp; Mr. 
Romanes knows very well that I have never said anything which 
could warrant his attempting to put the absurdity into my mouth 
which he here tries to do.&nbsp; The reader who wishes to see 
what I do maintain upon this subject will find it on pp. 216-218 
of the present volume.</p>

<p>Talking of legs, as I went through the main street of Dalpe an
old lady of about sixty-five stopped me, and told me that while 
gathering her winter store of firewood she had had the misfortune
to hurt her leg.&nbsp; I was very sorry, but I failed to satisfy 
her; the more I sympathised in general terms, the more I felt 
that something further was expected of me.&nbsp; I went on trying
to do the civil thing, when the old lady cut me short by saying 
it would be much better if I were to see the leg at once; so she 
showed it me in the street, and there, sure enough, close to the 
groin there was a swelling.&nbsp; Again I said how sorry I was, 
and added that perhaps she ought to show it to a medical 
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t <i>you</i> a medical 
man?&rdquo; said she in an alarmed manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly
not, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then why did you
let me show you my leg?&rdquo; said she indignantly, and pulling 
her clothes down, the poor old woman began to hobble off; 
presently two others joined her, and I heard hearty peals of 
laughter as she <!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>recounted her story.&nbsp; A 
stranger visiting these out-of-the-way villages is almost certain
to be mistaken for a doctor.&nbsp; What business, they say to 
themselves, can any one else have there, and who in his senses 
would dream of visiting them for pleasure?&nbsp; This old lady 
had rushed to the usual conclusion, and had been trying to get a 
little advice gratis.</p>

<p>The little objects looking like sentry-boxes that go all round
Prato Church contain rough modern frescoes representing, if I 
remember rightly, the events attendant upon the 
crucifixion.&nbsp; These are on a small scale what the chapels on
the sacred mountain of Varallo are on a large one.&nbsp; Small 
single oratories are scattered about all over the Canton Ticino, 
and indeed everywhere in North Italy, by the road-side, at all 
halting-places, and especially at the crest of any more marked 
ascent, where the tired wayfarer, probably heavy laden, might be 
inclined to say a naughty word or two if not checked.&nbsp; The 
people like them, and miss them when they come to England.&nbsp; 
They sometimes do what the lower animals do in confinement when 
precluded from habits they are accustomed to, and put up with 
strange makeshifts by way of substitute.&nbsp; I once saw a poor 
Ticinese woman kneeling in prayer before a dentist&rsquo;s 
show-case in the Hampstead Road; she doubtless mistook the teeth 
for the relics of some saint.&nbsp; I am afraid she was a little 
like a hen sitting upon a chalk egg, but she seemed quite 
contented.</p>
<p>Which of us, indeed, does not sit contentedly enough upon 
chalk eggs at times?&nbsp; And what would life be but for the 
power to do so?&nbsp; We do not sufficiently realise the part 
which illusion has played in our <!-- page 257--><a 
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
257</span>development.&nbsp; One of the prime requisites for 
evolution is a certain power for adaptation to varying 
circumstances, that is to say, of plasticity, bodily and 
mental.&nbsp; But the power of adaptation is mainly dependent on 
the power of thinking certain new things sufficiently like 
certain others to which we have been accustomed for us not to be 
too much incommoded by the change&mdash;upon the power, in fact, 
of mistaking the new for the old.&nbsp; The power of fusing ideas
(and through ideas, structures) depends upon the power of 
<i>con</i>fusing them; the power to confuse ideas that are not 
very unlike, and that are presented to us in immediate sequence, 
is mainly due to the fact of the impetus, so to speak, which the 
mind has upon it.&nbsp; It is this which bars association from 
sticking to the letter of its bond; for we are in a hurry to jump
to a conclusion on the first show of plausible pretext, and cut 
association&rsquo;s statement of claim short by taking it as read
before we have got through half of it.&nbsp; We &ldquo;get it 
into our notes, in fact,&rdquo; as Mr. Justice Stareleigh did in 
Pickwick, and having got it once in, we are not going to get it 
out again.&nbsp; This breeds fusion and confusion, and from this 
there come new developments.</p>
<p>So powerful is the impetus which the mind has continually upon
it that we always, I believe, make an effort to see every new 
object as a repetition of the object last before us.&nbsp; 
Objects are so varied and present themselves so rapidly, that as 
a general rule we renounce this effort too promptly to notice it,
but it is always there, and as I have just said, it is because of
it that we are able to mistake, and hence to evolve new mental 
and bodily developments.&nbsp; Where the effort is successful, 
there is illusion; where nearly successful but not quite, there 
is a shock and a sense <!-- page 258--><a 
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>of being 
puzzled&mdash;more or less, as the case may be; where it so 
obviously impossible as not to be pursued, there is no perception
of the effort at all.</p>
<p>Mr. Locke has been greatly praised for his essay upon human 
understanding.&nbsp; An essay on human misunderstanding should be
no less interesting and important.&nbsp; Illusion to a small 
extent is one of the main causes, if indeed it is not the main 
cause, of progress, but it must be upon a small scale.&nbsp; All 
abortive speculation, whether commercial or philosophical, is 
based upon it, and much as we may abuse such speculation, we are,
all of us, its debtors.</p>

<p>I know few things more touching in their way than the porch of
Rossura Church: it is dated early in the last century, and is 
absolutely without ornament; the flight of steps inside it lead 
up to the level of the floor of the church.&nbsp; One lovely 
summer Sunday morning passing the church betimes, I saw the 
people kneeling upon these steps, the church within being 
crammed.&nbsp; In the darker light of the porch, they told out 
against the sky that showed through the open arch beyond them; 
far away the eye rested on the mountains&mdash;deep blue, save 
where the snow still lingered.&nbsp; I never saw anything more 
beautiful&mdash;and these forsooth are the people whom so many of
us think to better by distributing tracts about Protestantism 
among them!</p>
<p>I liked the porch almost best under an aspect which it no 
longer presents.&nbsp; One summer an opening was made in the west
wall, which was afterwards closed because the wind blew through 
it too much and made the church too cold.&nbsp; While it was 
open, one could sit on the church steps and look down through it 
on to the bottom of the Ticino valley; and through the <!-- page 
259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
259</span>windows one could see the slopes about Dalpe and 
Cornone.&nbsp; Between the two windows there is a picture of 
austere old S. Carlo Borromeo with his hands joined in 
prayer.</p>
<p>It was at Rossura that I made the acquaintance of a word which
I have since found very largely used throughout North 
Italy.&nbsp; It is pronounced &ldquo;chow&rdquo; pure and simple,
but is written, if written at all, &ldquo;ciau&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;ciao,&rdquo; the &ldquo;a&rdquo; being kept very 
broad.&nbsp; I believe the word is derived from 
&ldquo;schiavo,&rdquo; a slave, which became corrupted into 
&ldquo;schiao,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ciao.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is used 
with two meanings, both of which, however, are deducible from the
word slave.&nbsp; In its first and more common use it is simply a
salute, either on greeting or taking leave, and means, &ldquo;I 
am your very obedient servant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, if one has been
talking to a small child, its mother will tell it to say 
&ldquo;chow&rdquo; before it goes away, and will then nod her 
head and say &ldquo;chow&rdquo; herself.&nbsp; The other use is a
kind of pious expletive, intending &ldquo;I must endure 
it,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am the slave of a higher power.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
It was in this sense I first heard it at Rossura.&nbsp; A woman 
was washing at a fountain while I was eating my lunch.&nbsp; She 
said she had lost her daughter in Paris a few weeks 
earlier.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was a beautiful woman,&rdquo; said the 
bereaved mother, &ldquo;but&mdash;chow.&nbsp; She had great 
talents&mdash;chow.&nbsp; I had her educated by the nuns of 
Bellinzona&mdash;chow.&nbsp; Her knowledge of geography was 
consummate&mdash;chow, chow,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Here 
&ldquo;chow&rdquo; means &ldquo;pazienza,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have 
done and said all that I can, and must now bear it as best I 
may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to comfort her, but could do nothing, till at last it 
occurred to me to say &ldquo;chow&rdquo; too.&nbsp; I did so, and
was astonished at the soothing effect it had upon her.&nbsp; How 
subtle are the laws that govern consolation!&nbsp; <!-- page 
260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>I 
suppose they must ultimately be connected with 
reproduction&mdash;the consoling idea being a kind of small cross
which <i>re-generates</i> or <i>re-creates</i> the 
sufferer.&nbsp; It is important, therefore, that the new ideas 
with which the old are to be crossed should differ from these 
last sufficiently to divert the attention, and yet not so much as
to cause a painful shock.</p>
<p>There should be a little shock, or there will be no variation 
in the new ideas that are generated, but they will resemble those
that preceded them, and grief will be continued; there must not 
be too great a shock or there will be no illusion&mdash;no 
confusion and fusion between the new set of ideas and the old, 
and in consequence there will be no result at all, or, if any, an
increase in mental discord.&nbsp; We know very little, however, 
upon this subject, and are continually shown to be at fault by 
finding an unexpectedly small cross produce a wide diversion of 
the mental images, while in other cases a wide one will produce 
hardly any result.&nbsp; Sometimes again, a cross which we should
have said was much too wide will have an excellent effect.&nbsp; 
I did not anticipate, for example, that my saying 
&ldquo;chow&rdquo; would have done much for the poor woman who 
had lost her daughter: the cross did not seem wide enough: she 
was already, as I thought, saturated with 
&ldquo;chow.&rdquo;&nbsp; I can only account for the effect my 
application of it produced by supposing the word to have derived 
some element of strangeness and novelty as coming from a 
foreigner&mdash;just as land which will give a poor crop, if 
planted with sets from potatoes that have been grown for three or
four years on this same soil, will yet yield excellently if 
similar sets be brought from twenty miles off.&nbsp; For the 
potato, so far as I have studied it, is a good-tempered, 
frivolous plant, <!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>easily amused and easily bored, and 
one, moreover, which if bored, yawns horribly.</p>
<p>I may say in passing that the tempers of plants have not been 
sufficiently studied; and what little opinion we have formed 
about their dispositions is for the most part ill formed.&nbsp; 
The sulkiest tree that I know is the silver beech.&nbsp; It never
forgives a scratch.&mdash;There is a tree in Kensington gardens a
little off the west side of the Serpentine with names cut upon it
as long ago as 1717 and 1736, which the tree is as little able to
forgive and forget as though the injury had been done not ten 
years since.&nbsp; And the tree is not an aged tree either.</p>
<h3><!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span

sanctuaries</span>.)</h3>
<p>Our inventions increase in geometrical ratio.&nbsp; They are 
like living beings, each one of which may become parent of a 
dozen others&mdash;some good and some ne&rsquo;er-do-weels; but 
they differ from animals and vegetables inasmuch as they not only
increase in a geometrical ratio, but the period of their 
gestation decreases in geometrical ratio also.&nbsp; Take this 
matter of Alpine roads for example.&nbsp; For how many millions 
of years was there no approach to a road over the St. Gothard, 
save the untutored watercourses of the Ticino and the Reuss, and 
the track of the bouquetin or the chamois?&nbsp; For how many 
more ages after this was there not a mere shepherd&rsquo;s or 
huntsman&rsquo;s path by the river-side&mdash;without so much as 
a log thrown over so as to form a rude bridge?&nbsp; No one would
probably have ever thought of making a bridge out of his own 
unaided imagination, more than any monkey that we know of has 
done so.&nbsp; But an avalanche or a flood once swept a pine into
position and left it there; on this a genius, who was doubtless 
thought to be doing something very infamous, ventured to make use
of it.&nbsp; Another time a pine was found nearly across the 
stream, but not quite; and not quite, again, in the place where 
it was wanted.&nbsp; A second genius, to the horror of his 
fellow-tribesmen&mdash;who declared that this <!-- page 263--><a 
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>time the 
world really would come to an end&mdash;shifted the pine a few 
feet so as to bring it across the stream and into the place where
it was wanted.&nbsp; This man was the inventor of 
bridges&mdash;his family repudiated him, and he came to a bad 
end.&nbsp; From this to cutting down the pine and bringing it 
from some distance is an easy step.&nbsp; To avoid detail, let us
come to the old Roman horse-road over the Alps.&nbsp; The time 
between the shepherd&rsquo;s path and the Roman road is probably 
short in comparison with that between the mere chamois track and 
the first thing that can be called a path of men.&nbsp; From the 
Roman we go on to the medi&aelig;val road with more frequent 
stone bridges, and from the medi&aelig;val to the Napoleonic 
carriage-road.</p>
<p>The close of the last century and the first quarter of this 
present one was the great era for the making of 
carriage-roads.&nbsp; Fifty years have hardly passed, and here we
are already in the age of tunnelling and railroads.&nbsp; The 
first period, from the chamois track to the foot road, was one of
millions of years; the second, from the first foot road to the 
Roman military way, was one of many thousands; the third, from 
the Roman to the medi&aelig;val, was perhaps a thousand; from the
medi&aelig;val to the Napoleonic, five hundred; from the 
Napoleonic to the railroad, fifty.&nbsp; What will come next we 
know not, but it should come within twenty years, and will 
probably have something to do with electricity.</p>
<p>It follows by an easy process of reasoning that after another 
couple of hundred years or so, great sweeping changes should be 
made several times in an hour, or indeed in a second, or fraction
of a second, till they pass unnoticed as the revolutions we 
undergo in the embryonic stages, or are felt simply as 
vibrations.&nbsp; <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>This would undoubtedly be the case 
but for the existence of a friction which interferes between 
theory and practice.&nbsp; This friction is caused partly by the 
disturbance of vested interests which every invention involves, 
and which will be found intolerable when men become millionaires 
and paupers alternately once a fortnight&mdash;living one week in
a palace and the next in a workhouse, and having perpetually to 
be sold up, and then to buy a new house and refurnish, 
&amp;c.&mdash;so that artificial means for stopping inventions 
will be adopted; and partly by the fact that though all 
inventions breed in geometrical ratio, yet some multiply more 
rapidly than others, and the backwardness of one art will impede 
the forwardness of another.&nbsp; At any rate, so far as I can 
see, the present is about the only comfortable time for a man to 
live in, that either ever has been or ever will be.&nbsp; The 
past was too slow, and the future will be much too fast.</p>
<p>The fact is (but it is so obvious that I am ashamed to say 
anything about it) that science is rapidly reducing time and 
space to a very undifferentiated condition.&nbsp; Take lamb: we 
can get lamb all the year round.&nbsp; This is perpetual spring; 
but perpetual spring is no spring at all; it is not a season; 
there are no more seasons, and being no seasons, there is no 
time.&nbsp; Take rhubarb, again.&nbsp; Rhubarb to the philosopher
is the beginning of autumn, if indeed the philosopher can see 
anything as the beginning of anything.&nbsp; If any one asks why,
I suppose the philosopher would say that rhubarb is the beginning
of the fruit season, which is clearly autumnal, according to our 
present classification.&nbsp; From rhubarb to the green 
gooseberry the step is so small as to require no 
bridging&mdash;with one&rsquo;s eyes shut, and plenty of cream 
and sugar, they <!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>are almost 
indistinguishable&mdash;but the gooseberry is quite an autumnal 
fruit, and only a little earlier than apples and plums, which 
last are almost winter; clearly, therefore, for scientific 
purposes rhubarb is autumnal.</p>
<p>As soon as we can find gradations, or a sufficient number of 
uniting links between two things, they become united or made one 
thing, and any classification of them must be illusory.&nbsp; 
Classification is only possible where there is a shock given to 
the senses by reason of a perceived difference, which, if it is 
considerable, can be expressed in words.&nbsp; When the world was
younger and less experienced, people were shocked at what 
appeared great differences between living forms; but species, 
whether of animals or plants, are now seen to be so united, 
either inferentially or by actual finding of the links, that all 
classification is felt to be arbitrary.&nbsp; The seasons are 
like species&mdash;they were at one time thought to be clearly 
marked, and capable of being classified with some approach to 
satisfaction.&nbsp; It is now seen that they blend either in the 
present or the past insensibly into one another, much as Mr. 
Herbert Spencer shows us that geology and astronomy blend into 
one another, <a name="citation265"></a><a href="#footnote265" 
class="citation">[265]</a> and cannot be classified except by 
cutting Gordian knots in a way which none but plain sensible 
people can tolerate.&nbsp; Strictly speaking, there is only one 
place, one time, one action, and one individual or thing; of this
thing or individual each one of us is a part.&nbsp; It is 
perplexing, but it is philosophy; and modern philosophy, like 
modern music, is nothing if it is not perplexing.</p>
<p>A simple verification of the autumnal character of rhubarb 
may, at first sight, appear to be found in Covent Garden Market, 
where we can actually see <!-- page 266--><a 
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>the rhubarb
towards the end of October.&nbsp; But this way of looking at the 
matter argues a fatal ineptitude for the pursuit of true 
philosophy.&nbsp; It would be &ldquo;the most serious 
error&rdquo; to regard the rhubarb that will appear in Covent 
Garden Market next October as belonging to the autumn then 
supposed to be current.&nbsp; Practically, no doubt, it does so, 
but theoretically it must be considered as the first-fruits of 
the autumn (if any) of the following year, which begins before 
the preceding summer (or, perhaps, more strictly, the preceding 
summer but one&mdash;and hence, but any number), has well 
ended.&nbsp; Whether this, however, is so or no, the rhubarb can 
be seen in Covent Garden, and I am afraid it must be admitted 
that to the philosophically minded there lurks within it a theory
of evolution, and even Pantheism, as surely as Theism was lurking
in Bishop Berkeley&rsquo;s tar-water.</p>
<p>To return, however, to Calonico.&nbsp; The <i>curato</i> was 
very kind to me.&nbsp; We had long talks together.&nbsp; I could 
see it pained him that I was not a Catholic.&nbsp; He could never
quite get over this, but he was very good and tolerant.&nbsp; He 
was anxious to be assured that I was not one of those English who
went about distributing tracts, and trying to convert 
people.&nbsp; This of course was the last thing I should have 
wished to do; and when I told him so, he viewed me with sorrow 
but henceforth without alarm.</p>
<p>All the time I was with him I felt how much I wished I could 
be a Catholic in Catholic countries, and a Protestant in 
Protestant ones.&nbsp; Surely there are some things which like 
politics are too serious to be taken quite seriously.&nbsp; 
<i>Surtout point de z&egrave;le</i> is not the saying of a cynic,
but the conclusion of a sensible man; and the more deep our 
feeling is about any <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>matter, the more occasion have we to
be on our guard against <i>z&egrave;le</i> in this particular 
respect.&nbsp; There is but one step from the 
&ldquo;earnest&rdquo; to the &ldquo;intense.&rdquo;&nbsp; When 
St. Paul told us to be all things to all men he let in the thin 
end of the wedge, nor did he mark it to say how far it was to be 
driven.</p>
<p>I have Italian friends whom I greatly value, and who tell me 
they think I flirt just a trifle too much with &ldquo;<i>il 
partito nero</i>,&rdquo; when I am in Italy, for they know that 
in the main I think as they do.&nbsp; &ldquo;These people,&rdquo;
they say, &ldquo;make themselves very agreeable to you, and show 
you their smooth side; we, who see more of them, know their rough
one.&nbsp; Knuckle under to them, and they will perhaps 
condescend to patronise you; have any individuality of your own, 
and they know neither scruple nor remorse in their attempts to 
get you out of their way.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Il prete</i>&rsquo; 
they say, with a significant look, &lsquo;<i>&egrave; sempre 
prete</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; For the future let us have professors and
men of science instead of priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smile to myself at this last, and reply, that I am a 
foreigner come among them for recreation, and anxious to keep 
clear of their internal discords.&nbsp; I do not wish to cut 
myself off from one side of their national character&mdash;a side
which, in some respects, is no less interesting than the one with
which I suppose I am on the whole more sympathetic.&nbsp; If I 
were an Italian, I should feel bound to take a side; as it is, I 
wish to leave all quarrelling behind me, having as much of that 
in England as suffices to keep me in good health and temper.</p>
<p>In old times people gave their spiritual and intellectual sop 
to Nemesis.&nbsp; Even when most positive, they admitted a 
percentage of doubt.&nbsp; Mr. Tennyson <!-- page 268--><a 
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>has said 
well, &ldquo;There lives more doubt&rdquo;&mdash;I quote from 
memory&mdash;&ldquo;in honest faith, believe me, than in half 
the&rdquo; systems of philosophy, or words to that effect.&nbsp; 
The victor had a slave at his ear during his triumph; the slaves 
during the Roman Saturnalia, dressed in their masters&rsquo; 
clothes, sat at meat with them, told them of their faults, and 
blacked their faces for them.&nbsp; They made their masters wait 
upon them.&nbsp; In the ages of faith, an ass dressed in 
sacerdotal robes was gravely conducted to the cathedral choir at 
a certain season, and mass was said before him, and hymns chanted
discordantly.&nbsp; The elder D&rsquo;Israeli, from whom I am 
quoting, writes: &ldquo;On other occasions, they put burnt old 
shoes to fume in the censors: ran about the church leaping, 
singing, dancing, and playing at dice upon the altar, while a 
<i>boy bishop</i> or <i>pope of fools</i> burlesqued the divine 
service;&rdquo; and later on he says: &ldquo;So late as 1645, a 
pupil of Gassendi, writing to his master what he himself 
witnessed at Aix on the Feast of Innocents, says&mdash;&lsquo;I 
have seen in some monasteries in this province extravagances 
solemnised which pagans would not have practised.&nbsp; Neither 
the clergy nor the guardians indeed go to the choir on this day, 
but all is given up to the lay brethren, the cabbage-cutters, 
errand boys, cooks, scullions, and gardeners; in a word, all the 
menials fill their places in the church, and insist that they 
perform the offices proper for the day.&nbsp; They dress 
themselves with all the sacerdotal ornaments, but torn to rags, 
or wear them inside out: they hold in their hands the books 
reversed or sideways, which they pretend to read with large 
spectacles without glasses, and to which they fix the rinds of 
scooped oranges . . . ! particularly while dangling the censers 
they keep shaking them in derision, and letting the <!-- page 
269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
269</span>ashes fly about their heads and faces, one against the 
other.&nbsp; In this equipage they neither sing hymns nor psalms 
nor masses, but mumble a certain gibberish as shrill and 
squeaking as a herd of pigs whipped on to market.&nbsp; The 
nonsense verses they chant are singularly barbarous:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;H&aelig;c est clara dies, clararum 
clara dierum,<br />
H&aelig;c est festa dies festarum festa dierum.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a 
name="citation269"></a><a href="#footnote269" 
class="citation">[269]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faith was far more assured in the times when the spiritual 
saturnalia were allowed than now.&nbsp; The irreverence which was
not dangerous then, is now intolerable.&nbsp; It is a bad sign 
for a man&rsquo;s peace in his own convictions when he cannot 
stand turning the canvas of his life occasionally upside down, or
reversing it in a mirror, as painters do with their pictures that
they may judge the better concerning them.&nbsp; I would persuade
all Jews, Mohammedans, Comtists, and freethinkers to turn high 
Anglicans, or better still, downright Catholics for a week in 
every year, and I would send people like Mr. Gladstone to attend 
Mr. Bradlaugh&rsquo;s lectures in the forenoon, and the Grecian 
pantomime in the evening, two or three times every winter.&nbsp; 
I should perhaps tell them that the Grecian pantomime has nothing
to do with Greek plays.&nbsp; They little know how much more 
keenly they would relish their normal opinions during the rest of
the year for the little spiritual outing which I would prescribe 
for them, which, after all, is but another phase of the wise 
saying&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Surtout point de 
z&egrave;le</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; St. Paul attempted an obviously 
hopeless task (as the Church of Rome very well understands) when 
he tried to put down seasonarianism.&nbsp; People must and will 
go to church to <!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>be a little better, to the theatre 
to be a little naughtier, to the Royal Institution to be a little
more scientific, than they are in actual life.&nbsp; It is only 
by pulsations of goodness, naughtiness, and whatever else we 
affect that we can get on at all.&nbsp; I grant that when in his 
office, a man should be exact and precise, but our holidays are 
our garden, and too much precision here is a mistake.</p>
<p>Surely truces, without even an <i>arri&egrave;re 
pens&eacute;e</i> of difference of opinion, between those who are
compelled to take widely different sides during the greater part 
of their lives, must be of infinite service to those who can 
enter on them.&nbsp; There are few merely spiritual pleasures 
comparable to that derived from the temporary laying down of a 
quarrel, even though we may know that it must be renewed 
shortly.&nbsp; It is a great grief to me that there is no place 
where I can go among Mr. Darwin, Professors Huxley, Tyndal, and 
Ray Lankester, Miss Buckley, Mr. Romanes, Mr. Grant Allen and 
others whom I cannot call to mind at this moment, as I can go 
among the Italian priests.&nbsp; I remember in one monastery (but
this was not in the Canton Ticino) the novice taught me how to 
make sacramental wafers, and I played him Handel on the organ as 
well as I could.&nbsp; I told him that Handel was a Catholic; he 
said he could tell that by his music at once.&nbsp; There is no 
chance of getting among our scientists in this way.</p>
<p>Some friends say I was telling a lie when I told the novice 
Handel was a Catholic, and ought not to have done so.&nbsp; I 
make it a rule to swallow a few gnats a day, lest I should come 
to strain at them, and so bolt camels; but the whole question of 
lying is difficult.&nbsp; What <i>is</i> 
&ldquo;lying&rdquo;?&nbsp; Turning for moral guidance to <!-- 
page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
271</span>my cousins the lower animals, whose unsophisticated 
nature proclaims what God has taught them with a directness we 
may sometimes study, I find the plover lying when she lures us 
from her young ones under the fiction of a broken wing.&nbsp; Is 
God angry, think you, with this pretty deviation from the letter 
of strict accuracy? or was it not He who whispered to her to tell
the falsehood&mdash;to tell it with a circumstance, without 
conscientious scruple, not once only, but to make a practice of 
it so as to be a plausible, habitual, and professional liar for 
some six weeks or so in the year?&nbsp; I imagine so.&nbsp; When 
I was young I used to read in good books that it was God who 
taught the bird to make her nest, and if so He probably taught 
each species the other domestic arrangements best suited to 
it.&nbsp; Or did the nest-building information come from God, and
was there an evil one among the birds also who taught them at any
rate to steer clear of priggishness?</p>
<p>Think of the spider again&mdash;an ugly creature, but I 
suppose God likes it.&nbsp; What a mean and odious lie is that 
web which naturalists extol as such a marvel of ingenuity!</p>
<p>Once on a summer afternoon in a far country I met one of those
orchids who make it their business to imitate a fly with their 
petals.&nbsp; This lie they dispose so cunningly that real flies,
thinking the honey is being already plundered, pass them without 
molesting them.&nbsp; Watching intently and keeping very still, 
methought I heard this orchid speaking to the offspring which she
felt within her, though I saw them not.&nbsp; &ldquo;My 
children,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I must soon leave you; 
think upon the fly, my loved ones, for this is truth; cling to 
this great thought in your passage <!-- page 272--><a 
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>through 
life, for it is the one thing needful; once lose sight of it and 
you are lost!&rdquo;&nbsp; Over and over again she sang this 
burden in a small still voice, and so I left her.&nbsp; Then 
straightway I came upon some butterflies whose profession it was 
to pretend to believe in all manner of vital truths which in 
their inner practice they rejected; thus, asserting themselves to
be certain other and hateful butterflies which no bird will eat 
by reason of their abominable smell, these cunning ones conceal 
their own sweetness, and live long in the land and see good 
days.&nbsp; No: lying is so deeply rooted in nature that we may 
expel it with a fork, and yet it will always come back again: it 
is like the poor, we must have it always with us.&nbsp; We must 
all eat a peck of moral dirt before we die.</p>
<p>All depends upon who it is that is lying.&nbsp; One man may 
steal a horse when another may not look over a hedge.&nbsp; The 
good man who tells no lies wittingly to himself and is never 
unkindly, may lie and lie and lie whenever he chooses to other 
people, and he will not be false to any man: his lies become 
truths as they pass into the hearers&rsquo; ear.&nbsp; If a man 
deceives himself and is unkind, the truth is not in him; it turns
to falsehood while yet in his mouth, like the quails in the 
Wilderness of Sinai.&nbsp; How this is so or why, I know not, but
that the Lord hath mercy on whom He will have mercy and whom He 
willeth He hardeneth.&nbsp; My Italian friends are doubtless in 
the main right about the priests, but there are many exceptions, 
as they themselves gladly admit.&nbsp; For my own part I have 
found the <i>curato</i> in the small subalpine villages of North 
Italy to be more often than not a kindly excellent man to whom I 
am attracted by sympathies deeper than any mere superficial 
differences of opinion <!-- page 273--><a 
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>can 
counteract.&nbsp; With monks, however, as a general rule, I am 
less able to get on: nevertheless I have received much courtesy 
at the hands of some.</p>
<p>My young friend the novice was delightful&mdash;only it was so
sad to think of the future that is before him.&nbsp; He wanted to
know all about England, and when I told him it was an island, 
clasped his hands and said, &ldquo;Oh che 
Providenza!&rdquo;&nbsp; He told me how the other young men of 
his own age plagued him as he trudged his rounds high up among 
the most distant hamlets begging alms for the poor.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Be a good fellow,&rdquo; they would say to him, 
&ldquo;drop all this nonsense and come back to us, and we will 
never plague you again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he would turn upon them
and put their words from him.&nbsp; Of course my sympathies were 
with the other young men rather than with him, but it was 
impossible not to be sorry for the manner in which he had been 
humbugged from the day of his birth, till he was now incapable of
seeing things from any other standpoint than that of 
authority.</p>
<p>What he said to me about knowing that Handel was a Catholic by
his music, put me in mind of what another good Catholic once said
to me about a picture.&nbsp; He was a Frenchman and very nice, 
but a <i>d&eacute;vot</i>, and anxious to convert me.&nbsp; He 
paid a few days&rsquo; visit to London, so I showed him the 
National Gallery.&nbsp; While there I pointed out to him 
Sebastian del Piombo&rsquo;s picture of the raising of Lazarus as
one of the supposed masterpieces of our collection.&nbsp; He had 
the proper orthodox fit of admiration over it, and then we went 
through the other rooms.&nbsp; After a while we found ourselves 
before West&rsquo;s picture of &ldquo;Christ healing the 
Sick.&rdquo;&nbsp; My French friend did not, I suppose, examine 
it very carefully, at any rate he believed he was again <!-- page
274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
274</span>before the raising of Lazarus by Sebastian del Piombo; 
he paused before it, and had his fit of admiration over again: 
then turning to me he said, &ldquo;Ah! you would understand this 
picture better if you were a Catholic.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not 
tell him of his mistake.</p>

<a name="citation275"></a><a href="#footnote275" 
class="citation">[275]</a></h3>
<p>An excursion which may be very well made from Faido is to the 
Val Piora, which I have already more than once mentioned.&nbsp; 
There is a large hotel here which has been opened some years, but
has not hitherto proved the success which it was hoped it would 
be.&nbsp; I have stayed there two or three times and found it 
very comfortable; doubtless, now that Signer Lombardi of the 
Hotel Prosa has taken it, it will become a more popular place of 
resort.</p>
<p>I took a trap from Faido to Ambri, and thence walked over to 
Quinto; here the path begins to ascend, and after an hour Ronco 
is reached.&nbsp; There is a house at Ronco where refreshments 
and excellent Faido beer can be had.&nbsp; The old lady who keeps
the house would make a perfect Fate; I saw her sitting at her 
window spinning, and looking down over the Ticino valley as 
though it were the world and she were spinning its destiny.&nbsp;
She had a somewhat stern expression, thin lips, iron-grey eyes, 
and an aquiline nose; her scanty locks straggled from under the 
handkerchief which she wore round her head.&nbsp; Her employment 
and the wistful far-away look she cast upon the expanse below 
made a very fine <i>ensemble</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;She would have 
afforded,&rdquo; <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>as Sir Walter Scott says, &ldquo;a 
study for a Rembrandt, had that celebrated painter existed at the
period,&rdquo; <a name="citation276"></a><a href="#footnote276" 
class="citation">[276]</a> but she must have been a 
smart-looking, handsome girl once.</p>
<p>She brightened up in conversation.&nbsp; I talked about Piora,
which I already knew, and the <i>Lago Tom</i>, the highest of the
three lakes.&nbsp; She said she knew the <i>Lago Tom</i>.&nbsp; I
said laughingly, &ldquo;Oh, I have no doubt you do.&nbsp; 
We&rsquo;ve had many a good day at the <i>Lago Tom</i>, I 
know.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked down at once.</p>
<p>In spite of her nearly eighty years she was active as a woman 
of forty, and altogether she was a very grand old lady.&nbsp; Her
house is scrupulously clean.&nbsp; While I watched her spinning, 
I thought of what must so often occur to summer visitors.&nbsp; I
mean what sort of a look-out the old woman must have in winter, 
when the wind roars and whistles, and the snow drives down the 
valley with a fury of which we in England can have little 
conception.&nbsp; What a place to see a snowstorm from! and what 
a place from which to survey the landscape next morning after the
storm is over and the air is calm and brilliant.&nbsp; There are 
such mornings: I saw one once, but I was at the bottom of the 
valley and not high up, as at Ronco.&nbsp; Ronco would take a 
little sun even in midwinter, but at the bottom of the valley 
there is no sun for weeks and weeks together; all is in deep 
shadow below, though the upper hill-sides may be seen to have the
sun upon them.&nbsp; I walked once on a frosty winter&rsquo;s 
morning from Airolo to Giornico, and can call to mind nothing in 
its way more beautiful: everything was locked in 
frost&mdash;there was not a watershed but was sheeted and coated 
with ice: the road was hard as granite&mdash;<!-- page 277--><a 
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>all was 
quiet, and seen as through a dark but incredibly transparent 
medium.&nbsp; Near Piotta I met the whole village dragging a 
large tree; there were many men and women dragging at it, but 
they had to pull hard, and they were silent; as I passed them I 
thought what comely, well-begotten people they were.&nbsp; Then, 
looking up, there was a sky, cloudless and of the deepest blue, 
against which the snow-clad mountains stood out splendidly.&nbsp;
No one will regret a walk in these valleys during the depth of 
winter.&nbsp; But I should have liked to have looked down from 
the sun into the sunlessness, as the old Fate woman at Ronco can 
do when she sits in winter at her window; or again, I should like
to see how things would look from this same window on a leaden 
morning in midwinter after snow has fallen heavily and the sky is
murky and much darker than the earth.&nbsp; When the storm is at 
its height, the snow must search and search and search even 
through the double windows with which the houses are 
protected.&nbsp; It must rest upon the frames of the pictures of 
saints, and of the sisters &ldquo;grab,&rdquo; and of the last 
hours of Count Ugolino, which adorn the walls of the 
parlour.&nbsp; No wonder there is a <i>S. Maria della 
Neve</i>,&mdash;a &ldquo;St. Mary of the Snow;&rdquo; but I do 
wonder that she has not been painted.</p>
<p>I said this to an Italian once, and he said the reason was 
probably this&mdash;that St. Mary of the Snow was not developed 
till long after Italian art had begun to decline.&nbsp; I suppose
in another hundred years or so we shall have a <i>St. Maria delle
Ferrovie</i>&mdash;a St. Mary of the Railways.</p>
<p>From Ronco the path keeps level and then descends a little so 
as to cross the stream that comes down from Piora.&nbsp; This is 
near the village of Altanca, the church of which looks remarkably
well from here.&nbsp; Then there <!-- page 278--><a 
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>is an hour 
and a half&rsquo;s rapid ascent, and at last all on a sudden one 
finds oneself on the <i>Lago Ritom</i>, close to the hotel.</p>
<p>The lake is about a mile, or a mile and a half, long, and half
a mile broad.&nbsp; It is 6000 feet above the sea, very deep at 
the lower end, and does not freeze where the stream issues from 
it, so that the magnificent trout with which it abounds can get 
air and live through the winter.&nbsp; In many other lakes, as, 
for example, the <i>Lago di Tremorgio</i>, they cannot do this, 
and hence perish, though the lakes have been repeatedly 
stocked.&nbsp; The trout in the <i>Lago Ritom</i> are said to be 
the finest in the world, and certainly I know none so fine 
myself.&nbsp; They grow to be as large as moderate-sized salmon, 
and have a deep-red flesh, very firm and full of flavour.&nbsp; I
had two cutlets off one for breakfast, and should have said they 
were salmon unless I had known otherwise.&nbsp; In winter, when 
the lake is frozen over, the people bring their hay from the 
farther Lake of Cadagna in sledges across the Lake Ritom.&nbsp; 
Here, again, winter must be worth seeing, but on a rough snowy 
day Piora must be an awful place.&nbsp; There are a few stunted 
pines near the hotel, but the hillsides are for the most part 
bare and green.&nbsp; Piora in fact is a fine breezy open upland 
valley of singular beauty, and with a sweet atmosphere of cow 
about it; it is rich in rhododendrons and all manner of Alpine 
flowers, just a trifle bleak, but as bracing as the Engadine 
itself.</p>
<p>The first night I was ever in Piora there was a brilliant 
moon, and the unruffled surface of the lake took the reflection 
of the mountains.&nbsp; I could see the cattle a mile off, and 
hear the tinkling of their bells which danced multitudinously 
before the ear as fire-flies come and go before the eyes; for all
through a fine summer&rsquo;s night <!-- page 279--><a 
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>the cattle 
will feed as though it were day.&nbsp; A little above the lake I 
came upon a man in a cave before a furnace, burning lime, and he 
sat looking into the fire with his back to the moonlight.&nbsp; 
He was a quiet moody man, and I am afraid I bored him, for I 
could get hardly anything out of him but &ldquo;Oh 
altro&rdquo;&mdash;polite but not communicative.&nbsp; So after a
while I left him with his face burnished as with gold from the 
fire, and his back silver with the moonbeams; behind him were the
pastures and the reflections in the lake and the mountains and 
the distant ringing of the cowbells.</p>
<p>Then I wandered on till I came to the chapel of S. Carlo; and 
in a few minutes found myself on the <i>Lugo di 
Cadagna</i>.&nbsp; Here I heard that there were people, and the 
people were not so much asleep as the simple peasantry of these 
upland valleys are expected to be by nine o&rsquo;clock in the 
evening.&nbsp; For now was the time when they had moved up from 
Ronco, Altanca, and other villages in some numbers to cut the 
hay, and were living for a fortnight or three weeks in the 
chalets upon the <i>Lago di Cadagna</i>.&nbsp; As I have said, 
there is a chapel, but I doubt whether it is attended during this
season with the regularity with which the parish churches of 
Ronco, Altanca, &amp;c., are attended during the rest of the 
year.&nbsp; The young people, I am sure, like these annual visits
to the high places, and will be hardly weaned from them.&nbsp; 
Happily the hay will be always there, and will have to be cut by 
some one, and the old people will send the young ones.</p>
<p>As I was thinking of these things, I found myself going off 
into a doze, and thought the burnished man from the furnace came 
up and sat beside me, and laid his hand upon my shoulder.&nbsp; 
Then I saw the green slopes that rise all round the lake were 
much higher <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>than I had thought; they went up 
thousands of feet, and there were pine forests upon them, while 
two large glaciers came down in streams that ended in a precipice
of ice, falling sheer into the lake.&nbsp; The edges of the 
mountains against the sky were rugged and full of clefts, through
which I saw thick clouds of dust being blown by the wind as 
though from the other side of the mountains.</p>
<p>And as I looked, I saw that this was not dust, but people 
coming in crowds from the other side, but so small as to be 
visible at first only as dust.&nbsp; And the people became 
musicians, and the mountainous amphitheatre a huge orchestra, and
the glaciers were two noble armies of women-singers in white 
robes, ranged tier above tier behind each other, and the pines 
became orchestral players, while the thick dust-like cloud of 
chorus-singers kept pouring in through the clefts in the 
precipices in inconceivable numbers.&nbsp; When I turned my 
telescope upon them I saw they were crowded up to the extreme 
edge of the mountains, so that I could see underneath the soles 
of their boots as their legs dangled in the air.&nbsp; In the 
midst of all, a precipice that rose from out of the glaciers 
shaped itself suddenly into an organ, and there was one whose 
face I well knew sitting at the keyboard, smiling and pluming 
himself like a bird as he thundered forth a giant fugue by way of
overture.&nbsp; I heard the great pedal notes in the bass stalk 
majestically up and down, as the rays of the Aurora that go about
upon the face of the heavens off the coast of Labrador.&nbsp; 
Then presently the people rose and sang the chorus &ldquo;Venus 
Laughing from the Skies;&rdquo; but ere the sound had well died 
away, I awoke, and all was changed; a light fleecy cloud had 
filled the whole basin, but I still thought I <!-- page 281--><a 
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>heard a 
sound of music, and a scampering-off of great crowds from the 
part where the precipices should be.&nbsp; After that I heard no 
more but a little singing from the chalets, and turned 
homewards.&nbsp; When I got to the chapel of S. Carlo, I was in 
the moonlight again, and when near the hotel, I passed the man at
the mouth of the furnace with the moon still gleaming upon his 
back, and the fire upon his face, and he was very grave and 
quiet.</p>
<h3><!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>S. MICHELE AND MONTE 
PIRCHIRIANO.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">extracts from chapters 
vii. and x. of alps and sanctuaries</span>.)</h3>
<p>The history of the sanctuary of S. Michele is briefly as 
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>At the close of the tenth century, when Otho III. was Emperor 
of Germany, a certain Hugh de Montboissier, a noble of Auvergne, 
commonly called &ldquo;Hugh the Unsewn&rdquo; (<i>lo 
sdruscito</i>), was commanded by the Pope to found a monastery in
expiation of some grave offence.&nbsp; He chose for his site the 
summit of the Monte Pirchiriano in the valley of Susa, being 
attracted partly by the fame of a church already built there by a
recluse of Ravenna, Giovanni Vincenzo by name, and partly by the 
striking nature of the situation.&nbsp; Hugh de Montboissier, 
when returning from Rome to France with Isengarde his wife, 
would, as a matter of course, pass through the valley of 
Susa.&nbsp; The two&mdash;perhaps when stopping to dine at S. 
Ambrogio&mdash;would look up and observe the church founded by 
Giovannia Vincenzo: they had got to build a monastery somewhere; 
it would very likely, therefore, occur to them that they could 
not perpetuate their names better than by choosing this site, 
which was on a much-travelled road, and on which a fine building 
would show to advantage.&nbsp; If my view is correct, we have 
here an <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>illustration of a fact which is 
continually observable&mdash;namely, that all things which come 
to much, whether they be books, buildings, pictures, music, or 
living beings, are begotten of others of their own kind.&nbsp; It
is always the most successful, like Handel and Shakespeare, who 
owe most to their forerunners, in spite of the modifications with
which their works descend.</p>
<p>Giovanni Vincenzo had built his church about the year 
987.&nbsp; It is maintained by some that he had been bishop of 
Ravenna, but Clareta gives sufficient reason for thinking 
otherwise.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Cronaca Clusina&rdquo; it is said 
that he had for some years previously lived as a recluse on the 
Monte Caprasio, to the north of the present Monte Pirchiriano; 
but that one night he had a vision, in which he saw the summit of
Monte Pirchiriano enveloped in heaven-descended flames, and on 
this founded a church there, and dedicated it to S. 
Michael.&nbsp; This is the origin of the name Pirchiriano, which 
means &pi;&upsilon;&rho; 
&kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;, or the 
Lord&rsquo;s fire.</p>
<p>Avogadro is among those who make Giovanni Bishop, or rather 
Archbishop, of Ravenna, and gives the following account of the 
circumstances which led to his resigning his diocese and going to
live at the top of the inhospitable Monte Caprasio.&nbsp; It 
seems there had been a confirmation at Ravenna, during which he 
had accidentally forgotten to confirm the child of a certain 
widow.&nbsp; The child, being in weakly health, died before 
Giovanni could repair his oversight, and this preyed upon his 
mind.&nbsp; In answer, however, to his earnest prayers, it 
pleased the Almighty to give him power to raise the dead child to
life again; this he did, and having immediately performed the 
rite of confirmation, restored the boy to his overjoyed 
mother.&nbsp; He now became so much revered that he began to be 
<!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
284</span>alarmed lest pride should obtain dominion over him; he 
felt, therefore, that his only course was to resign his diocese, 
and go and live the life of a recluse on the top of some high 
mountain.&nbsp; It is said that he suffered agonies of doubt as 
to whether it was not selfish of him to take such care of his own
eternal welfare, at the expense of that of his flock, whom no 
successor could so well guide and guard from evil; but in the end
he took a reasonable view of the matter, and concluded that his 
first duty was to secure his own spiritual position.&nbsp; 
Nothing short of the top of a very uncomfortable mountain could 
do this, so he at once resigned his bishopric and chose Monte 
Caprasio as on the whole the most comfortable uncomfortable 
mountain he could find.</p>
<p>The latter part of the story will seem strange to 
Englishmen.&nbsp; We can hardly fancy the Archbishop of 
Canterbury or York resigning his diocese and settling down 
quietly on the top of Scafell or Cader Idris to secure his 
eternal welfare.&nbsp; They would hardly do so even on the top of
Primrose Hill.&nbsp; But nine hundred years ago human nature was 
not the same as now-a-days.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Comparing our own clergy with the best North Italian and 
Ticinese priests, I should say there was little to choose between
them.&nbsp; The latter are in a logically stronger position, and 
this gives them greater courage in their opinions; the former 
have the advantage in respect of money, and the more varied 
knowledge of the world which money will command.&nbsp; When I say
Catholics have logically the advantage over Protestants, I mean 
that starting from premises which both sides admit, a merely 
logical Protestant <!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>will find himself driven to the 
Church of Rome.&nbsp; Most men as they grow older will, I think, 
feel this, and they will see in it the explanation of the 
comparatively narrow area over which the Reformation extended, 
and of the gain which Catholicism has made of late years here in 
England.&nbsp; On the other hand, reasonable people will look 
with distrust upon too much reason.&nbsp; The foundations of 
action lie deeper than reason can reach.&nbsp; They rest on 
faith&mdash;for there is no absolutely certain incontrovertible 
premise which can be laid by man, any more than there is any 
investment for money or security in the daily affairs of life 
which is absolutely unimpeachable.&nbsp; The Funds are not 
absolutely safe; a volcano might break out under the Bank of 
England.&nbsp; A railway journey is not absolutely safe; one 
person at least in several millions gets killed.&nbsp; We invest 
our money upon faith, mainly.&nbsp; We choose our doctor upon 
faith, for how little independent judgment can we form concerning
his capacity?&nbsp; We choose schools for our children chiefly 
upon faith.&nbsp; The most important things a man has are his 
body, his soul, and his money.&nbsp; It is generally better for 
him to commit these interests to the care of others of whom he 
can know little, rather than be his own medical man, or invest 
his money on his own judgment; and this is nothing else than 
making a faith which lies deeper than reason can reach, the basis
of our action in those respects which touch us most nearly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as good a case could be made out for 
placing reason as the foundation, inasmuch as it would be easy to
show that a faith, to be worth anything, must be a reasonable 
one&mdash;one, that is to say, which is based upon reason.&nbsp; 
The fact is that faith and reason are like function and organ, 
desire and power, or <!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>demand and supply; it is impossible 
to say which comes first: they come up hand in hand, and are so 
small when we can first descry them, that it is impossible to say
which we first caught sight of.&nbsp; All we can now see is that 
each has a tendency continually to outstrip the other by a 
little, but by a very little only.&nbsp; Strictly they are not 
two things, but two aspects of one thing; for convenience&rsquo; 
sake, however, we classify them separately.</p>
<p>It follows, therefore&mdash;but whether it follows or no, it 
is certainly true&mdash;that neither faith alone nor reason alone
is a sufficient guide: a man&rsquo;s safety lies neither in faith
nor reason, but in temper&mdash;in the power of fusing faith and 
reason, even when they appear most mutually destructive.</p>
<p>That we all feel temper to be the first thing is plain from 
the fact that when we see two men quarrelling we seldom even try 
to weigh their arguments&mdash;we look instinctively at the tone 
or spirit or temper which the two display and give our verdict 
accordingly.</p>
<p>A man of temper will be certain in spite of uncertainty, and 
at the same time uncertain in spite of certainty; reasonable in 
spite of his resting mainly upon faith rather than reason, and 
full of faith even when appealing most strongly to reason.&nbsp; 
If it is asked, In what should a man have faith?&nbsp; To what 
faith should he turn when reason has led him to a conclusion 
which he distrusts? the answer is, To the current feeling among 
those whom he most looks up to&mdash;looking upon himself with 
suspicion if he is either among the foremost or the 
laggers.&nbsp; In the rough, homely common sense of the community
to which we belong we have as firm ground as can be got.&nbsp; 
This, though not absolutely infallible, is secure enough for 
practical purposes.</p>
<p>As I have said, Catholic priests have rather a fascination 
<!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
287</span>for me&mdash;when they are not Englishmen.&nbsp; I 
should say that the best North Italian priests are more openly 
tolerant than our English clergy generally are.&nbsp; I remember 
picking up one who was walking along a road, and giving him a 
lift in my trap.&nbsp; Of course we fell to talking, and it came 
out that I was a member of the Church of England.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ebbene, Caro Signore,&rdquo; said he when we shook hands 
at parting; &ldquo;mi rincresce che lei non crede come io, ma in 
questi tempi non possiamo avere tutti i medesimi 
principii.&rdquo; <a name="citation287"></a><a 
href="#footnote287" class="citation">[287]</a></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The one thing, he said, which shocked him with the English, 
was the manner in which they went about distributing tracts upon 
the Continent.&nbsp; I said no one could deplore the practice 
more profoundly than myself, but that there were stupid and 
conceited people in every country, who would insist upon 
thrusting their opinions upon people who did not want them.&nbsp;
He replied that the Italians travelled not a little in England, 
but that he was sure not one of them would dream of offering 
Catholic tracts to people, for example, in the streets of 
London.&nbsp; Certainly I have never seen an Italian to be guilty
of such rudeness.&nbsp; It seems to me that it is not only 
toleration that is a duty; we ought to go beyond this now; we 
should conform, when we are among a sufficient number of those 
who would not understand our refusal to do so; any other course 
is to attach too much importance at once to our own opinions and 
to those of our opponents.&nbsp; By all means let a man stand by 
his convictions when the occasion requires, but let him reserve 
his strength, unless it is imperatively called for.&nbsp; Do not 
let him <!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>exaggerate trifles, and let him 
remember that everything is a trifle in comparison with the not 
giving offence to a large number of kindly, simple-minded 
people.&nbsp; Evolution, as we all know, is the great doctrine of
modern times; the very essence of evolution consists in the not 
shocking anything too violently, but enabling it to mistake a new
action for an old one, without &ldquo;making believe&rdquo; too 
much.</p>
<p>One day when I was eating my lunch near a fountain, there came
up a moody, meditative hen, crooning plaintively after her 
wont.&nbsp; I threw her a crumb of bread while she was still a 
good way off, and then threw more, getting her to come a little 
closer and a little closer each time; at last she actually took a
piece from my hand.&nbsp; She did not quite like it, but she did 
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very little at a time,&rdquo; this is the 
evolution principle; and if we wish those who differ from us to 
understand us, it is the only method to proceed upon.&nbsp; I 
have sometimes thought that some of my friends among the priests 
have been treating me as I treated the meditative hen.&nbsp; But 
what of that?&nbsp; They will not kill and eat me, nor take my 
eggs.&nbsp; Whatever, therefore, promotes a more friendly feeling
between us must be pure gain.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Sometimes priests say things, as a matter of course, which 
would make any English clergyman&rsquo;s hair stand on end.&nbsp;
At one town there is a remarkable fourteenth-century bridge, 
commonly known as &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Bridge.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
was sketching near this when a jolly old priest with a red nose 
came up and began a conversation with me.&nbsp; He was evidently 
a popular character, for every one who passed greeted him.&nbsp; 
He told me that the devil did not really build the bridge.&nbsp; 
I said <!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>I presumed not, for he was not in 
the habit of spending his time so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he had built it,&rdquo; said my friend; 
&ldquo;for then perhaps he would build us some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or we might even get a church out of him,&rdquo; said 
I, a little slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! we will convert him, and make a good 
Christian of him in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When will our Protestantism, or Rationalism, or whatever it 
may be, sit as lightly upon ourselves?</p>
<p>Another time I had the following dialogue with an old 
Piedmontese priest who lived in a castle which I asked permission
to go over:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vous &ecirc;tes Anglais, monsieur?&rdquo; said he in 
French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oui, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vous &ecirc;tes Catholique?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, je suis de la religion de mes 
anc&ecirc;tres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, monsieur, vos anc&ecirc;tres &eacute;taient 
Catholiques jusqu&rsquo;au temps de Henri Huit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mais il y a trois cents ans depuis le temps de Henri 
Huit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh bien; chacun a ses convictions; vous ne parlez pas 
contre la religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jamais, jamais, monsieur, j&rsquo;ai un respect enorme 
pour l&rsquo;&eacute;glise Catholique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, faites comme chez vous; allez ou vous voulez;
vous trouverez toutes les portes ouvertes.&nbsp; Amusez vous 
bien.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>CONSIDERATIONS ON THE DECLINE OF 
ITALIAN ART.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">from chapter xiii. of 
alps and sanctuaries</span>.)</h3>
<p>Those who know the Italians will see no sign of decay about 
them.&nbsp; They are the quickest-witted people in the world, and
at the same time have much more of the old Roman steadiness than 
they are generally credited with.&nbsp; Not only is there no sign
of degeneration, but, as regards practical matters, there is 
every sign of health and vigorous development.&nbsp; The North 
Italians are more like Englishmen, both in body, and mind, than 
any other people whom I know; I am continually meeting Italians 
whom I should take for Englishmen if I did not know their 
nationality.&nbsp; They have all our strong points, but they have
more grace and elasticity of mind than we have.</p>
<p>Priggishness is the sin which doth most easily beset 
middle-class, and so-called educated Englishmen; we call it 
purity and culture, but it does not much matter what we call 
it.&nbsp; It is the almost inevitable outcome of a university 
education, and will last as long as Oxford and Cambridge do, but 
not much longer.</p>
<p>Lord Beaconsfield sent Lothair to Oxford; it is with great 
pleasure that I see he did not send Endymion.&nbsp; My friend 
Jones called my attention to this, and we noted that the growth 
observable throughout Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s life was 
continued to the end.&nbsp; He was <!-- page 291--><a 
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>one of 
those who, no matter how long he lived, would have been always 
growing: this is what makes his later novels so much better than 
those of Thackeray or Dickens.&nbsp; There was something of the 
child about him to the last.&nbsp; Earnestness was his greatest 
danger, but if he did not quite overcome it (as who indeed 
can?&nbsp; It is the last enemy that shall be subdued), he 
managed to veil it with a fair amount of success.&nbsp; As for 
Endymion, of course if Lord Beaconsfield had thought Oxford would
be good for him, he could, as Jones pointed out to me, just as 
well have killed Mr. Ferrars a year or two later.&nbsp; We feel 
satisfied, therefore, that Endymion&rsquo;s exclusion from a 
university was carefully considered, and are glad.</p>
<p>I will not say that priggishness is absolutely unknown among 
the North Italians; sometimes one comes upon a young Italian who 
wants to learn German, but not often.&nbsp; Priggism, or whatever
the substantive is, is as essentially a Teutonic vice as holiness
is a Semitic characteristic; and if an Italian happens to be a 
prig, he will, like Tacitus, invariably show a hankering after 
German institutions.&nbsp; The idea, however, that the Italians 
were ever a finer people than they are now, will not pass muster 
with those who knew them.</p>
<p>At the same time, there can be no doubt that modern Italian 
art is in many respects as bad as it was once good.&nbsp; I will 
confine myself to painting only.&nbsp; The modern Italian 
painters, with very few exceptions, paint as badly as we do, or 
even worse, and their motives are as poor as is their 
painting.&nbsp; At an exhibition of modern Italian pictures, I 
generally feel that there is hardly a picture on the walls but is
a sham&mdash;that is to say, painted not from love of this 
particular subject and an <!-- page 292--><a 
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
292</span>irresistible desire to paint it, but from a wish to 
paint an academy picture, and win money or applause.</p>
<p>The last rays of the sunset of genuine art are to be found in 
the votive pictures at Locarno or Oropa, and in many a wayside 
chapel.&nbsp; In these, religious art still lingers as a living 
language, however rudely spoken.&nbsp; In these alone is the 
story told, not as in the Latin and Greek verses of the scholar, 
who thinks he has succeeded best when he has most concealed his 
natural manner of expressing himself, but by one who knows what 
he wants to say, and says it in his mother-tongue, shortly, and 
without caring whether or not his words are in accordance with 
academic rules.&nbsp; I regret to see photography being 
introduced for votive purposes, and also to detect in some places
a disposition on the part of the authorities to be a little 
ashamed of these pictures and to place them rather out of 
sight.</p>
<p>The question is, how has the falling-off in Italian painting 
been caused?&nbsp; And by doing what may we again get Bellinis 
and Andrea Mantegnas as in old time?&nbsp; The fault does not lie
in any want of raw material: nor yet does it lie in want of 
taking pains.&nbsp; The modern Italian painter frets himself to 
the full as much as his predecessor did&mdash;if the truth were 
known, probably a great deal more.&nbsp; I am sure Titian did not
take much pains after he was more than about twenty years 
old.&nbsp; It does not lie in want of schooling or art 
education.&nbsp; For the last three hundred years, ever since the
Caraccis opened their academy at Bologna, there has been no lack 
of art education in Italy.&nbsp; Curiously enough, the date of 
the opening of the Bolognese Academy coincides as nearly as may 
be with the complete decadence of Italian painting.&nbsp; The 
academic system trains boys to study other people&rsquo;s works 
rather <!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>than nature, and, as Leonardo da 
Vinci so well says, it makes them nature&rsquo;s grandchildren 
and not her children.&nbsp; This I believe is at any rate half 
the secret of the whole matter.</p>
<p>If half-a-dozen young Italians could be got together with a 
taste for drawing; if they had power to add to their number; if 
they were allowed to see paintings and drawings done up to the 
year A.D. 1510, and votive pictures and the comic papers; if they
were left with no other assistance than this, absolutely free to 
please themselves, and could be persuaded not to try and please 
any one else, I believe that in fifty years we should have all 
that was ever done repeated with fresh na&iuml;vet&eacute;, and 
as much more delightfully than even by the best old masters, as 
these are more delightful than anything we know of in classic 
painting.&nbsp; The young plants keep growing up abundantly every
day&mdash;look at Bastianini, dead not ten years since&mdash;but 
they are browsed down by the academies.&nbsp; I remember there 
came out a book many years ago with the title, &ldquo;What 
becomes of all the clever little children?&rdquo;&nbsp; I never 
saw the book, but the title is pertinent.</p>
<p>Any man who can write, can draw to a not inconsiderable 
extent.&nbsp; Look at the Bayeux tapestry; yet Matilda probably 
never had a drawing lesson in her life.&nbsp; See how well 
prisoner after prisoner in the Tower of London has cut out this 
or that in the stone of his prison wall, without, in all 
probability, having ever tried his hand at drawing before.&nbsp; 
Look at my friend Jones, who has several illustrations in this 
book. <a name="citation294"></a><a href="#footnote294" 
class="citation">[294]</a>&nbsp; The first year he went abroad 
with me he could hardly draw at all.&nbsp; He was no year away 
from England more <!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>than three weeks.&nbsp; How did he 
learn?&nbsp; On the old principle, if I am not mistaken.&nbsp; 
The old principle was for a man to be doing something which he 
was pretty strongly bent on doing, and to get a much younger one 
to help him.&nbsp; The younger paid nothing for instruction, but 
the elder took the work, as long as the relation of master and 
pupil existed between them.&nbsp; I, then, was mailing 
illustrations for this book, and got Jones to help me.&nbsp; I 
let him see what I was doing, and derive an idea of the sort of 
thing I wanted, and then left him alone&mdash;beyond giving him 
the same kind of small criticism that I expected from 
himself&mdash;but I appropriated his work.&nbsp; That is the way 
to teach, and the result was that in an incredibly short time 
Jones could draw.&nbsp; The taking the work is a <i>sine 
qu&acirc; non</i>.&nbsp; If I had not been going to have his 
work, Jones, in spite of all his quickness, would probably have 
been rather slower in learning to draw.&nbsp; Being paid in money
is nothing like so good.</p>
<p>This is the system of apprenticeship <i>versus</i> the 
academic system.&nbsp; The academic system consists in giving 
people the rules for doing things.&nbsp; The apprenticeship 
system consists in letting them do it, with just a trifle of 
supervision.&nbsp; &ldquo;For all a rhetorician&rsquo;s 
rules,&rdquo; says my great namesake, &ldquo;teach nothing but, 
to name his tools;&rdquo; and academic rules generally are much 
the same as the rhetorician&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Some men can pass 
through academies unscathed, but they are very few, and in the 
main the academic influence is a baleful one, whether exerted in 
a university or a school.&nbsp; While young men at universities 
are being prepared for their entry into life, their rivals have 
already entered it.&nbsp; The most university and examination 
ridden people in the world are the Chinese, and they are the 
least progressive.</p>
<p><!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>Men should learn to draw as they learn conveyancing: 
they should go into a painter&rsquo;s studio and paint on his 
pictures.&nbsp; I am told that half the conveyances in the 
country are drawn by pupils; there is no more mystery about 
painting than about conveyancing&mdash;not half in fact, I should
think, so much.&nbsp; One may ask, How can the beginner paint, or
draw conveyances, till he has learnt how to do so?&nbsp; The 
answer is, How can he learn, without at any rate trying to 
do?&nbsp; It is the old story, organ and function, power and 
desire, demand and supply, faith and reason, etc., the most 
virtuous action and interaction in the most vicious circle 
conceivable.&nbsp; If the beginner likes his subject, he will 
try: if he tries, he will soon succeed in doing something which 
shall open a door.&nbsp; It does not matter what a man does; so 
long as he does it with the attention which affection engenders, 
he will come to see his way to something else.&nbsp; After long 
waiting he will certainly find one door open, and go through 
it.&nbsp; He will say to himself that he can never find 
another.&nbsp; He has found this, more by luck than cunning, but 
now he is done.&nbsp; Yet by and by he will see that there is 
<i>one</i> more small unimportant door which he had overlooked, 
and he proceeds through this too.&nbsp; If he remains now for a 
long while and sees no other, do not let him fret; doors are like
the kingdom of heaven, they come not by observation, least of all
do they come by forcing: let him just go on doing what comes 
nearest, but doing it attentively, and a great wide door will one
day spring into existence where there had been no sign of one but
a little time previously.&nbsp; Only let him be always doing 
something, and let him cross himself now and again, for belief in
the wondrous efficacy of crosses and crossing is the <!-- page 
296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
296</span>corner-stone of the creed of the evolutionists.&nbsp; 
Then after years&mdash;but not probably till after a great 
many&mdash;doors will open up all around, so many and so wide 
that the difficulty will not be to find a door, but rather to 
obtain the means of even hurriedly surveying a portion of those 
that stand invitingly open.</p>
<p>I know that just as good a case can be made out for the other 
side.&nbsp; It may be said as truly that unless a student is 
incessantly on the watch for doors he will never see them, and 
that unless he is incessantly pressing forward to the kingdom of 
heaven he will never find it&mdash;so that the kingdom does come 
by observation.&nbsp; It is with this as with everything 
else&mdash;there must be a harmonious fusing of two principles 
which are in flat contradiction to one another.</p>
<p>The question of whether it is better to abide quiet and take 
advantage of opportunities that come, or to go farther afield in 
search of them, is one of the oldest which living beings have had
to deal with.&nbsp; It was on this that the first great schism or
heresy arose in what was heretofore the catholic faith of 
protoplasm.&nbsp; The schism still lasts, and has resulted in two
great sects&mdash;animals and plants.&nbsp; The opinion that it 
is better to go in search of prey is formulated in animals; the 
other&mdash;that it is better on the whole to stay at home and 
profit by what comes&mdash;in plants.&nbsp; Some intermediate 
forms still record to us the long struggle during which the 
schism was not yet complete.</p>
<p>If I may be pardoned for pursuing this digression further, I 
would say that it is the plants and not we who are the 
heretics.&nbsp; There can be no question about this; we are 
perfectly justified, therefore, in devouring them.&nbsp; Ours is 
the original and orthodox belief, for protoplasm is much more 
animal than vegetable; it is <!-- page 297--><a 
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>much more 
true to say that plants have descended from animals than animals 
from plants.&nbsp; Nevertheless, like many other heretics, plants
have thriven very fairly well.&nbsp; There are a great many of 
them, and as regards beauty, if not wit&mdash;of a limited kind 
indeed, but still wit&mdash;it is hard to say that the animal 
kingdom has the advantage.&nbsp; The views of plants are sadly 
narrow; all dissenters are narrow-minded; but within their own 
bounds they know the details of their business sufficiently 
well&mdash;as well as though they kept the most nicely-balanced 
system of accounts to show them their position.&nbsp; They are 
eaten, it is true; to eat them is our intolerant and bigoted way 
of trying to convert them: eating is only a violent mode of 
proselytising or converting; and we do convert them&mdash;to good
animal substance, of our own way of thinking.&nbsp; If we have 
had no trouble with them, we say they have &ldquo;agreed&rdquo; 
with us; if we have been unable to make them see things from our 
points of view, we say they &ldquo;disagree&rdquo; with us, and 
avoid being on more than distant terms with them for the 
future.&nbsp; If we have helped ourselves to too much, we say we 
have got more than we can &ldquo;manage.&rdquo;&nbsp; But then, 
animals are eaten too.&nbsp; They convert one another, almost as 
much as they convert plants.&nbsp; And an animal is no sooner 
dead than a plant will convert it back again.&nbsp; It is 
obvious, however, that no schism could have been so long 
successful, without having a good deal to say for itself.</p>
<p>Neither party has been quite consistent.&nbsp; Who ever is or 
can be?&nbsp; Every extreme&mdash;every opinion carried to its 
logical end&mdash;will prove to be an absurdity.&nbsp; Plants 
throw out roots and boughs and leaves: this is a kind of 
locomotion; and as Dr. Erasmus Darwin long since pointed out, 
they do sometimes approach <!-- page 298--><a 
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>nearly to 
what may be called travelling; a man of consistent character will
never look at a bough, a root, or a tendril without regarding it 
as a melancholy and unprincipled compromise.&nbsp; On the other 
hand, many animals are sessile, and some singularly successful 
genera, as spiders, are in the main liers-in-wait.&nbsp; It may 
appear, however, on the whole, like reopening a settled question 
to uphold the principle of being busy and attentive over a small 
area, rather than going to and fro over a larger one, for a 
mammal like man, but I think most readers will be with me in 
thinking that, at any rate as regards art and literature, it is 
he who does his small immediate work most carefully who will find
doors open most certainly to him, that will conduct him into the 
richest chambers.</p>
<p>Many years ago, in New Zealand, I used sometimes to accompany 
a dray and team of bullocks who would have to be turned loose at 
night that they might feed.&nbsp; There were no hedges or fences 
then, so sometimes I could not find my team in the morning, and 
had no clue to the direction in which they had gone.&nbsp; At 
first I used to try and throw my soul into the bullocks&rsquo; 
souls, so as to divine if possible what they would be likely to 
have done, and would then ride off ten miles in the wrong 
direction.&nbsp; People used in those days to lose their bullocks
sometimes for a week or fortnight&mdash;when they perhaps were 
all the time hiding in a gully hard by the place where they were 
turned out.&nbsp; After some time I changed my tactics.&nbsp; On 
losing my bullocks I would go to the nearest accommodation house,
and stand drinks.&nbsp; Some one would ere long, as a general 
rule, turn up who had seen the bullocks.&nbsp; This case does not
go quite on all fours with what I have been saying above, 
inasmuch as I was not very industrious <!-- page 299--><a 
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>in my 
limited area; but the standing drinks and inquiring was being as 
industrious as the circumstances would allow.</p>
<p>To return, universities and academies are an obstacle to the 
finding of doors in later life; partly because they push their 
young men too fast through doorways that the universities have 
provided, and so discourage the habit of being on the look-out 
for others; and partly because they do not take pains enough to 
make sure that their doors are <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> ones.&nbsp;
If, to change the metaphor, an academy has taken a bad shilling, 
it is seldom very scrupulous about trying to pass it on.&nbsp; It
will stick to it that the shilling is a good one as long as the 
police will let it.&nbsp; I was very happy at Cambridge; when I 
left it I thought I never again could be so happy anywhere else; 
I shall ever retain a most kindly recollection both of Cambridge 
and of the school where I passed my boyhood; but I feel, as I 
think most others must in middle life, that I have spent as much 
of my maturer years in unlearning as in learning.</p>
<p>The proper course is for a boy to begin the practical business
of life many years earlier than he now commonly does.&nbsp; He 
should begin at the very bottom of a profession; if possible of 
one which his family has pursued before him&mdash;for the 
professions will assuredly one day become hereditary.&nbsp; The 
ideal railway director will have begun at fourteen as a railway 
porter.&nbsp; He need not be a porter for more than a week or ten
days, any more than he need have been a tadpole more than a short
time; but he should take a turn in practice, though briefly, at 
each of the lower branches in the profession.&nbsp; The painter 
should do just the same.&nbsp; He should begin by setting his 
employer&rsquo;s palette and <!-- page 300--><a 
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>cleaning 
his brushes.&nbsp; As for the good side of universities, the 
proper preservative of this is to be found in the club.</p>
<p>If, then, we are to have a renaissance of art, there must be a
complete standing aloof from the academic system.&nbsp; That 
system has had time enough.&nbsp; Where and who are its 
men?&nbsp; Can it point to one painter who can hold his own with 
the men of, say, from 1450 to 1550?&nbsp; Academies will bring 
out men who can paint hair very like hair, and eyes very like 
eyes, but this is not enough.&nbsp; This is grammar and 
deportment; we want wit and a kindly nature, and these cannot be 
got from academies.&nbsp; As far as mere <i>technique</i> is 
concerned, almost every one now can paint as well as is in the 
least desirable.&nbsp; The same <i>mutatis mutandis</i> holds 
good with writing as with painting.&nbsp; We want less 
word-painting and fine phrases, and more observation at 
first-hand.&nbsp; Let us have a periodical illustrated by people 
who cannot draw, and written by people who cannot write (perhaps,
however, after all, we have some), but who look and think for 
themselves, and express themselves just as they please,&mdash;and
this we certainly have not.&nbsp; Every contributor should be at 
once turned out if he or she is generally believed to have tried 
to do something which he or she did not care about trying to do, 
and anything should be admitted which is the outcome of a genuine
liking.&nbsp; People are always good company when they are doing 
what they really enjoy.&nbsp; A cat is good company when it is 
purring, or a dog when it is wagging its tail.</p>
<p>The sketching-clubs up and down the country might form the 
nucleus of such a society, provided all professional men were 
rigorously excluded.&nbsp; As for the old masters, the better 
plan would be never even to <!-- page 301--><a 
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>look at one
of them, and to consign Raffaelle, along with Plato, Marcus 
Aurelius Antoninus, Dante, Goethe, and two others, neither of 
them Englishmen, to limbo, as the Seven Humbugs of 
Christendom.</p>
<p>While we are about it, let us leave off talking about 
&ldquo;art for art&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who is art, that it
should have a sake?&nbsp; A work of art should be produced for 
the pleasure it gives the producer, and the pleasure he thinks it
will give to a few of whom he is fond; but neither money nor 
people whom he does not know personally should be thought 
of.&nbsp; Of course such a society as I have proposed would not 
remain incorrupt long.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything that grows, holds 
in perfection but a little moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; The members would
try to imitate professional men in spite of their rules, or, if 
they escaped this and after a while got to paint well, they would
become dogmatic, and a rebellion against their authority would be
as necessary ere long as it was against that of their 
predecessors: but the balance on the whole would be to the 
good.</p>
<p>Professional men should be excluded, if for no other reason 
yet for this, that they know too much for the beginner to be 
<i>en rapport</i> with them.&nbsp; It is the beginner who can 
help the beginner, as it is the child who is the most instructive
companion for another child.&nbsp; The beginner can understand 
the beginner, but the cross between him and the proficient 
performer is too wide for fertility.&nbsp; It savours of 
impatience, and is in flat contradiction to the first principles 
of biology.&nbsp; It does a beginner positive harm to look at the
masterpieces of the great executionists, such as Rembrandt or 
Turner.</p>
<p>If one is climbing a very high mountain which will <!-- page 
302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
302</span>tax all one&rsquo;s strength, nothing fatigues so much 
as casting upward glances to the top; nothing encourages so much 
as casting downward glances.&nbsp; The top seems never to draw 
nearer; the parts that we have passed retreat rapidly.&nbsp; Let 
a water-colour student go and see the drawing by Turner in the 
basement of our National Gallery, dated 1787.&nbsp; This is the 
sort of thing for him, not to copy, but to look at for a minute 
or two now and again.&nbsp; It will show him nothing about 
painting, but it may serve to teach him not to overtax his 
strength, and will prove to him that the greatest masters in 
painting, as in everything else, begin by doing work which is no 
way superior to that of their neighbours.&nbsp; A collection of 
the earliest known works of the greatest men would be much more 
useful to the student than any number of their maturer works, for
it would show him that he need not worry himself because his work
does not look clever, or as silly people say, &ldquo;show 
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secrets of success are affection for the pursuit chosen, a
flat refusal to be hurried or to pass anything as understood 
which is not understood, and an obstinacy of character which 
shall make the student&rsquo;s friends find it less trouble to 
let him have his own way than to bend him into theirs.&nbsp; Our 
schools and academies or universities are covertly but 
essentially radical institutions, and abhorrent to the genius of 
Conservatism.&nbsp; Their sin is the true radical sin of being in
too great a hurry, and the natural result has followed, they 
waste far more time than they save.&nbsp; But it must be 
remembered that this proposition like every other wants tempering
with a slight infusion of its direct opposite.</p>
<p>I said in an early part of this book that the best <!-- page 
303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
303</span>test to know whether or no one likes a picture is to 
ask oneself whether one would like to look at it if one was quite
sure one was alone.&nbsp; The best test for a painter as to 
whether he likes painting his picture is to ask himself whether 
he should like to paint it if he was quite sure that no one 
except himself, and the few of whom he was very fond, would ever

he is all right; if he cannot, he is all wrong.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 304</span>SANCTUARIES OF OROPA AND 
GRAGLIA.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">from chapters xv. and xvi. of
alps and sanctuaries</span>.)</h3>
<p>The morning after our arrival at Biella, we took the daily 
diligence for Oropa, leaving Biella at eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
Before we were clear of the town we could see the long line of 
the hospice, and the chapels dotted about near it, high up in a 
valley at some distance off; presently we were shown another fine
building some eight or nine miles away, which we were told was 
the sanctuary of Graglia.&nbsp; About this time the pictures and 
statuettes of the Madonna began to change their hue and to become
black&mdash;for the sacred image of Oropa being black, all the 
Madonnas in her immediate neighbourhood are of the same 
complexion.&nbsp; Underneath some of them is written, 
&ldquo;Nigra sum sed sum formosa,&rdquo; which, as a rule, was 
more true as regards the first epithet than the second.</p>
<p>It was not market-day, but streams of people were coming to 
the town.&nbsp; Many of them were pilgrims returning from the 
sanctuary, but more were bringing the produce of their farms or 
the work of their hands for sale.&nbsp; We had to face a steady 
stream of chairs, which were coming to town in baskets upon 
women&rsquo;s heads.&nbsp; Each basket contained twelve chairs, 
though whether it is correct to say that the basket contained 
<!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
305</span>the chairs&mdash;when the chairs were all, so to say, 
froth running over the top of the basket&mdash;is a point I 
cannot settle.&nbsp; Certainly we had never seen anything like so
many chairs before, and felt almost as though we had surprised 
nature in the laboratory wherefrom she turns out the chair-supply
of the world.&nbsp; The road continued through a succession of 
villages almost running into one another for a long way after 
Biella was passed, but everywhere we noticed the same air of busy
thriving industry which we had seen in Biella itself.&nbsp; We 
noted also that a preponderance of the people had light hair, 
while that of the children was frequently nearly white, as though
the infusion of German blood was here stronger even than 
usual.&nbsp; Though so thickly peopled, the country was of great 
beauty.&nbsp; Near at hand were the most exquisite pastures close
shaven after their second mowing, gay with autumnal crocuses, and
shaded with stately chestnuts; beyond were rugged mountains, in a
combe on one of which we saw Oropa itself now gradually nearing; 
behind, and below, many villages, with vineyards and terraces 
cultivated to the highest perfection; farther on, Biella already 
distant, and beyond this a &ldquo;big stare,&rdquo; as an 
American might say, over the plains of Lombardy from Turin to 
Milan, with the Apennines from Genoa to Bologna hemming the 
horizon.&nbsp; On the road immediately before us, we still faced 
the same steady stream of chairs flowing ever Biella-ward.</p>
<p>After a couple of hours the houses became more rare; we got 
above the sources of the chair-stream; bits of rough rock began 
to jut out from the pasture; here and there the rhododendron 
began to shew itself by the roadside; the chestnuts left off 
along a line as level as though cut with a knife; stone-roofed 
<i>cascine</i> <!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>began to abound, with goats and 
cattle feeding near them; the booths of the religious 
trinket-mongers increased; the blind, halt, and maimed became 
more importunate, and the foot-passengers were more entirely 
composed of those whose object was, or had been, a visit to the 
sanctuary itself.&nbsp; The numbers of these 
pilgrims&mdash;generally in their Sunday&rsquo;s best, and often 
comprising the greater part of a family&mdash;were so great, 
though there was no special festa, as to testify to the 
popularity of the institution.&nbsp; They generally walked 
barefoot, and carried their shoes and stockings; their baggage 
consisted of a few spare clothes, a little food, and a pot or pan
or two to cook with.&nbsp; Many of them looked very tired, and 
had evidently tramped from long distances&mdash;indeed, we saw 
costumes belonging to valleys which could not be less than two or
three days distant.&nbsp; They were almost invariably quiet, 
respectable, and decently clad, sometimes a little merry, but 
never noisy, and none of them tipsy.&nbsp; As we travelled along 
the road, we must have fallen in with several hundreds of these 
pilgrims coming and going; nor is this likely to be an 
extravagant estimate, seeing that the hospice can make up more 
than five thousand beds.&nbsp; By eleven we were at the sanctuary
itself.</p>
<p>Fancy a quiet upland valley, the floor of which is about the 
same height as the top of Snowdon, shut in by lofty mountains 
upon three sides, while on the fourth the eye wanders at will 
over the plains below.&nbsp; Fancy finding a level space in such 
a valley watered by a beautiful mountain stream, and nearly 
filled by a pile of collegiate buildings, not less important than
those, we will say, of Trinity College, Cambridge.&nbsp; True, 
Oropa is not in the least like Trinity, except that one of its 
courts is large, grassy, has a chapel and a fountain <!-- page 
307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>in
it, and rooms all round it; but I do not know how better to give 
a rough description of Oropa than by comparing it with one of our
largest English colleges.</p>
<p>The buildings consist of two main courts.&nbsp; The first 
comprises a couple of modern wings, connected by the magnificent 
fa&ccedil;ade of what is now the second or inner court.&nbsp; 
This fa&ccedil;ade dates from about the middle of the seventeenth
century; its lowest storey is formed by an open colonnade, and 
the whole stands upon a raised terrace from which a noble flight 
of steps descends into the outer court.</p>
<p>Ascending the steps and passing under the colonnade, we find 
ourselves in the second or inner court, which is a complete 
quadrangle, and is, so at least we were told, of rather older 
date than the fa&ccedil;ade.&nbsp; This is the quadrangle which 
gives its collegiate character to Oropa.&nbsp; It is surrounded 
by cloisters on three sides, on to which the rooms in which the 
pilgrims are lodged open&mdash;those at least that are on the 
ground-floor, but there are three storeys.&nbsp; The chapel, 
which was dedicated in the year 1600, juts out into the court 
upon the north-east side.&nbsp; On the north-west and south-west 
sides are entrances through which one may pass to the open 
country.&nbsp; The grass at the time of our visit was for the 
most part covered with sheets spread out to dry.&nbsp; They 
looked very nice, and, dried on such grass, and in such an air, 
they must be delicious to sleep on.&nbsp; There is, indeed, 
rather an appearance as though it were a perpetual washing-day at
Oropa, but this is not to be wondered at considering the numbers 
of comers and goers; besides, people in Italy do not make so much
fuss about trifles as we do.&nbsp; If they want to wash their 
sheets and dry them, they do not send them to Ealing, but lay 
them out in the <!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 308</span>first place that comes handy, and 
nobody&rsquo;s bones are broken.</p>
<p>On the east side of the main block of buildings there is a 
grassy slope adorned with chapels that contain figures 
illustrating scenes in the history of the Virgin.&nbsp; These 
figures are of terra-cotta, for the most part life-size, and 
painted up to nature.&nbsp; In some cases, if I remember rightly,
they have hemp or flax for hair, as at Varallo, and throughout 
realism is aimed at as far as possible, not only in the figures, 
but in the accessories.&nbsp; We have very little of the same 
kind in England.&nbsp; In the Tower of London there is an effigy 
of Queen Elizabeth going to the city to give thanks for the 
defeat of the Spanish Armada.&nbsp; This looks as if it might 
have been the work of some one of the Valsesian sculptors.&nbsp; 
There are also the figures that strike the quarters of Sir John 
Bennett&rsquo;s city clock in Cheapside.&nbsp; The automatic 
movements of these last-named figures would have struck the 
originators of the Varallo chapels with envy.&nbsp; They aimed at
realism so closely that they would assuredly have had recourse to
clockwork in some one or two of their chapels; I cannot doubt, 
for example, that they would have eagerly welcomed the idea of 
making the cock crow to Peter by a cuckoo-clock arrangement, if 
it had been presented to them.&nbsp; This opens up the whole 
question of realism <i>versus</i> conventionalism in art&mdash;a 
subject much too large to be treated here.</p>
<p>As I have said, the founders of these Italian chapels aimed at
realism.&nbsp; Each chapel was intended as an illustration, and 
the desire was to bring the whole scene more vividly before the 
faithful by combining the picture, the statue, and the effect of 
a scene upon the stage in a single work of art.&nbsp; The attempt
would <!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>be an ambitious one though made once
only in a neighbourhood, but in most of the places in North Italy
where anything of the kind has been done, the people have not 
been content with a single illustration; it has been their scheme
to take a mountain as though it had been a book or wall and cover
it with illustrations.&nbsp; In some cases&mdash;as at Orta, 
whose Sacro Monte is perhaps the most beautiful of all as regards
the site itself&mdash;the failure is complete, but in some of the
chapels at Varese and in many of those at Varallo, great works 
have been produced which have not yet attracted as much attention
as they deserve.&nbsp; It may be doubted, indeed, whether there 
is a more remarkable work of art in North Italy than the 
crucifixion chapel at Varallo, where the twenty-five statues, as 
well as the frescoes behind them, are (with the exception of the 
figure of Christ, which has been removed) by Gaudenzio 
Ferrari.&nbsp; It is to be wished that some one of these 
chapels&mdash;both chapel and sculptures&mdash;were reproduced at
South Kensington.</p>
<p>Varallo, which is undoubtedly the most interesting sanctuary 
in North Italy, has forty-four of these illustrative chapels; 
Varese, fifteen; Orta, eighteen; and Oropa, seventeen.&nbsp; No 
one is allowed to enter them, except when repairs are needed; but
when these are going on, as is constantly the case, it is curious
to look through the grating into the somewhat darkened interior, 
and to see a living figure or two among the statues; a little 
motion on the part of a single figure seems to communicate itself
to the rest and make them all more animated.&nbsp; If the living 
figure does not move much, it is easy at first to mistake it for 
a terra-cotta one.&nbsp; At Orta, some years since, looking one 
evening into a chapel when the light was fading, I was surprised 
<!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
310</span>to see a saint whom I had not seen before; he had no 
glory except what shone from a very red nose; he was smoking a 
short pipe, and was painting the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; 
The touch was a finishing one, put on with deliberation, slowly, 
so that it was two or three seconds before I discovered that the 
interloper was no saint.</p>
<p>The figures in the chapels at Oropa are not as good as the 
best of those at Varallo, but some of them are very nice 
notwithstanding.&nbsp; We liked the seventh chapel the 
best&mdash;the one which illustrates the sojourn of the Virgin 
Mary in the Temple.&nbsp; It contains forty-four figures, and 
represents the Virgin on the point of completing her education as
head girl at a high-toned academy for young gentlewomen.&nbsp; 
All the young ladies are at work making mitres for the bishop, or
working slippers in Berlin wool for the new curate, but the 
Virgin sits on a dais above the others on the same platform with 
the venerable lady-principal, who is having passages read out to 
her from some standard Hebrew writer.&nbsp; The statues are the 
work of a local sculptor, named Aureggio, who lived at the end of
the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The highest chapel must be a couple of hundred feet above the 
main buildings, and from near it there is an excellent 
bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the sanctuary and the small plain 
behind; descending on to this last, we entered the quadrangle 
from the north-west side, and visited the chapel in which the 
sacred image of the Madonna is contained.&nbsp; We did not see 
the image itself, which is only exposed to public view on great 
occasions.&nbsp; It is believed to have been carved by St. Luke 
the Evangelist.&nbsp; It is said that at one time there was 
actually an inscription on the image in Greek characters, <!-- 
page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
311</span>of which the translation is, &ldquo;Eusebius.&nbsp; A 
token of respect and affection from his sincere friend, 
Luke;&rdquo; but this being written in chalk or pencil only, has 
been worn off, and is known by tradition only.&nbsp; I must ask 
the reader to content himself with the following account of it 
which I take from Marocco&rsquo;s work upon Oropa:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That this statue of the Virgin is indeed by
St. Luke is attested by St. Eusebius, a man of eminent piety, and
no less enlightened than truthful, and the store which he set by 
it is proved by his shrinking from no discomforts in his carriage
of it from a distant country, and by his anxiety to put it in a 
place of great security.&nbsp; His desire, indeed, was to keep it
in the spot which was most near and dear to him, so that he might
extract from it the higher incitement to devotion, and more 
sensible comfort in the midst of his austerities and apostolic 
labours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This truth is further confirmed by the quality of the 
wood from which the statue is carved, which is commonly believed 
to be cedar; by the Eastern character of the work; by the 
resemblance both of the lineament and the colour to those of 
other statues by St. Luke; by the tradition of the neighbourhood,
which extends in an unbroken and well-assured line to the time of
St. Eusebius himself; by the miracles that have been worked here 
by its presence, and elsewhere by its invocation, or even by 
indirect contact with it; by the miracles, lastly, which are 
inherent in the image itself, <a name="citation311"></a><a 
href="#footnote311" class="citation">[311]</a> and which endure 
to this day, such as is its immunity from all worm and from the 
decay which would <!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>naturally have occurred in it 
through time and damp&mdash;more especially in the feet, through 
the rubbing of religious objects against them.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;The authenticity of this image is so certainly and 
clearly established, that all supposition to the contrary becomes
inexplicable and absurd.&nbsp; Such, for example, is a hypothesis
that it should not be attributed to the Evangelist, but to 
another Luke, also called &lsquo;Saint,&rsquo; and a Florentine 
by birth.&nbsp; This painter lived in the eleventh 
century&mdash;that is to say, about seven centuries after the 
image of Oropa had been known and venerated!&nbsp; This is indeed
an anachronism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other difficulties drawn either from the ancient 
discipline of the Church or from St. Luke the Evangelist&rsquo;s 
profession, which was that of a physician, vanish at once when it
is borne in mind&mdash;firstly, that the cult of holy images, and
especially of that of the most blessed Virgin, is of extreme 
antiquity in the Church, and of apostolic origin, as is proved by
ecclesiastical writers and monuments found in the catacombs which
date, as far back as the first century (see among other 
authorities, Nicolas, La Vergine vivente nella Chiesa, lib. iii. 
cap. iii. &sect; 2); secondly, that as the medical profession 
does not exclude that of artists, St. Luke may have been both 
artist and physician; that he did actually handle both the brush 
and the scalpel is established by respectable and very old 
traditions, to say nothing of other arguments which can be found 
in impartial and learned writers upon such matters.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will only give one more extract.&nbsp; It runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In 1855 a celebrated Roman 
portrait-painter, after having carefully inspected the image of 
the Virgin <!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>Mary at Oropa, declared it to be 
certainly a work of the first century of our era.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation313"></a><a href="#footnote313" 
class="citation">[313]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I once saw a common cheap china copy of this Madonna announced
as to be given away with two pounds of tea, in a shop near Hatton
Garden.</p>
<p>The church in which the sacred image is kept is interesting 
from the pilgrims who at all times frequent it, and from the 
collection of votive pictures which adorn its walls.&nbsp; Except
the votive pictures and the pilgrims the church contains little 
of interest, and I will pass on to the constitution and objects 
of the establishment.</p>
<p>The objects are&mdash;1. Gratuitous lodging to all comers for 
a space of from three to nine days as the rector may think 
fit.&nbsp; 2. A school.&nbsp; 3. Help to the sick and poor.&nbsp;
It is governed by a president and six members, who form a 
committee.&nbsp; Four members are chosen by the communal council,
and two by the cathedral chapter of Biella.&nbsp; At the hospice 
itself there reside a director, with his assistant, a surveyor to
keep the fabric in repair, a rector or dean with six priests, 
called <i>cappellani</i>, and a medical man.&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
government of the laundry,&rdquo; so runs the statute on this 
head, &ldquo;and analogous domestic services are entrusted to a 
competent number of ladies of sound constitution and good 
conduct, who live together in the hospice under the direction of 
an inspectress, and are called daughters of Oropa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bye-laws of the establishment are conceived in a kindly, 
genial spirit, which in great measure accounts for its 
unmistakable popularity.&nbsp; We understood that the poorer 
visitors, as a general rule, avail themselves of the gratuitous 
lodging, without making any present when they leave, but in spite
of this it is quite clear <!-- page 314--><a 
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>that they 
are wanted to come, and come they accordingly do.&nbsp; It is 
sometimes difficult to lay one&rsquo;s hands upon the exact 
passages which convey an impression, but as we read the bye-laws 
which are posted up in the cloisters, we found ourselves 
continually smiling at the manner in which almost anything that 
looked like a prohibition could be removed with the consent of 
the director.&nbsp; There is no rule whatever about visitors 
attending the church; all that is required of them is that they 
do not interfere with those who do.&nbsp; They must not play 
games of chance, or noisy games; they must not make much noise of
any sort after ten o&rsquo;clock at night (which corresponds 
about with midnight in England).&nbsp; They should not draw upon 
the walls of their rooms, nor cut the furniture.&nbsp; They 
should also keep their rooms clean, and not cook in those that 
are more expensively furnished.&nbsp; This is about all that they
must not do, except fee the servants, which is most especially 
and particularly forbidden.&nbsp; If any one infringes these 
rules, he is to be admonished, and in case of grave infraction or
continued misdemeanor he may be expelled and not readmitted.</p>
<p>Visitors who are lodged in the better-furnished apartments can
be waited upon if they apply at the office; the charge is 
twopence for cleaning a room, making the bed, bringing water, 
&amp;c.&nbsp; If there is more than one bed in a room, a penny 
must be paid for every bed over the first.&nbsp; Boots can be 
cleaned for a penny, shoes for a halfpenny.&nbsp; For carrying 
wood, &amp;c., either a halfpenny or a penny will be exacted 
according to the time taken.&nbsp; Payment for these services 
must not be made to the servant, but at the office.</p>
<p>The gates close at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, and open at 
sunrise, &ldquo;but if any visitor wishes to make Alpine <!-- 
page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
315</span>excursions, or has any other sufficient reason, he 
should let the director know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Families occupying 
many rooms must&mdash;when the hospice is very crowded, and when 
they have had due notice&mdash;manage to pack themselves into a 
smaller compass.&nbsp; No one can have rooms kept for him.&nbsp; 
It is to be strictly &ldquo;first come, first 
served.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one must sublet his room.&nbsp; Visitors 
must not go away without giving up the key of their room.&nbsp; 
Candles and wood may be bought at a fixed price.</p>
<p>Any one wishing to give anything to the support of the hospice
must do so only to the director, the official who appoints the 
apartments, the dean or the cappellani, or to the inspectress of 
the daughters of Oropa, but they must have a receipt for even the
smallest sum; alms-boxes, however, are placed here and there into
which the smaller offerings may be dropped (we imagine this means
anything under a franc).</p>
<p>The poor will be fed as well as housed for three days 
gratuitously&mdash;provided their health does not require a 
longer stay; but they must not beg on the premises of the 
hospice; professional beggars will be at once handed over to the 
mendicity society in Biella, or even perhaps to prison.&nbsp; The
poor for whom a hydropathic course is recommended, can have it 
under the regulations made by the committee&mdash;that is to say,
if there is a vacant place.</p>
<p>There are <i>trattorie</i> and caf&eacute;s at the hospice, 
where refreshments may be obtained both good and cheap.&nbsp; 
Meat is to be sold there at the prices current in Biella; bread 
at two centimes the chilogramma more, to pay for the cost of 
carriage.</p>
<p>Such are the bye-laws of this remarkable institution.</p>
<p>Few except the very rich are so under-worked that <!-- page 
316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
316</span>two or three days of change and rest are not at times a
boon to them, while the mere knowledge that there is a place 
where repose can be had cheaply and pleasantly is itself a source
of strength.&nbsp; Here, so long as the visitor wishes to be 
merely housed, no questions are asked; no one is refused 
admittance, except for some obviously sufficient reason; it is 
like getting a reading ticket for the British Museum, there is 
practically but one test&mdash;that is to say, desire on the part
of the visitor&mdash;the coming proves the desire, and this 
suffices.&nbsp; A family, we will say, has just gathered its 
first harvest; the heat on the plains is intense, and the malaria
from the rice-grounds little less than pestilential; what, then, 
can be nicer than to lock up the house and go for three days to 
the bracing mountain air of Oropa?&nbsp; So at daybreak off they 
all start trudging, it may be, their thirty or forty miles, and 
reaching Oropa by nightfall.&nbsp; If there is a weakly one among
them, some arrangement is sure to be practicable whereby he or 
she can be helped to follow more leisurely, and can remain longer
at the hospice.&nbsp; Once arrived, they generally, it is true, 
go the round of the chapels, and make some slight show of 
pilgrimage, but the main part of their time is spent in doing 
absolutely nothing.&nbsp; It is sufficient amusement to them to 
sit on the steps, or lie about under the shadow of the trees, and
neither say anything nor do anything, but simply breathe, and 
look at the sky and at each other.&nbsp; We saw scores of such 
people just resting instinctively in a kind of blissful waking 
dream.&nbsp; Others saunter along the walks which have been cut 
in the woods that surround the hospice, or if they have been pent
up in a town and have a fancy for climbing, there are mountain 
excursions, for the making of which the hospice <!-- page 
317--><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
317</span>affords excellent headquarters, and which are looked 
upon with every favour by the authorities.</p>
<p>It must be remembered also that the accommodation provided at 
Oropa is much better than what the people are, for the most part,
accustomed to in their own homes, and the beds are softer, more 
often beaten up, and cleaner than those they have left behind 
them.&nbsp; Besides, they have sheets&mdash;and beautifully clean
sheets.&nbsp; Those who know the sort of place in which an 
Italian peasant is commonly content to sleep, will understand how
much he must enjoy a really clean and comfortable bed, especially
when he has not got to pay for it.&nbsp; Sleep, in the 
circumstances of comfort which most readers will be accustomed 
to, is a more expensive thing than is commonly supposed.&nbsp; If
we sleep eight hours in a London hotel we shall have to pay from 
4d. to 6d. an hour, or from 1d. to 1&frac12;d. for every fifteen 
minutes we lie in bed; nor is it reasonable to believe that the 
charge is excessive when we consider the vast amount of 
competition which exists.&nbsp; There is many a man the expenses 
of whose daily meat, drink, and clothing are less than what an 
accountant would show us we, many of us, lay out nightly upon our
sleep.&nbsp; The cost of really comfortable sleep-necessaries 
cannot, of course, be nearly so great at Oropa as in a London 
hotel, but they are enough to put them beyond the reach of the 
peasant under ordinary circumstances, and he relishes them all 
the more when he can get them.</p>
<p>But why, it may be asked, should the peasant have these things
if he cannot afford to pay for them; and why should he not pay 
for them if he can afford to do so?&nbsp; If such places as Oropa
were common, would not lazy vagabonds spend their lives in going 
the rounds of them, &amp;c., &amp;c.?&nbsp; Doubtless if there 
were many Oropas, <!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>they would do more harm than good, 
but there are some things which answer perfectly well as rarities
or on a small scale, out of which all the virtue would depart if 
they were common or on a larger one; and certainly the impression
left upon our minds by Oropa was that its effects were 
excellent.</p>
<p>Granted the sound rule to be that a man should pay for what he
has, or go without it; in practice, however, it is found 
impossible to carry this rule out strictly.&nbsp; Why does the 
nation give A. B., for instance, and all comers a large, 
comfortable, well-ventilated, warm room to sit in, with chair, 
table, reading-desk, &amp;c., all more commodious than what he 
may have at home, without making him pay a sixpence for it 
directly from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end?&nbsp; The 
three or nine days&rsquo; visit to Oropa is a trifle in 
comparison with what we can all of us obtain in London if we care
about it enough to take a very small amount of trouble.&nbsp; 
True, one cannot sleep in the reading-room of the British 
Museum&mdash;not all night, at least&mdash;but by day one can 
make a home of it for years together except during cleaning 
times, and then it is hard if one cannot get into the National 
Gallery or South Kensington, and be warm, quiet, and entertained 
without paying for it.</p>
<p>It will be said that it is for the national interest that 
people should have access to treasuries of art or knowledge, and 
therefore it is worth the nation&rsquo;s while to pay for placing
the means of doing so at their disposal; granted, but is not a 
good bed one of the great ends of knowledge, whereto it must 
work, if it is to be accounted knowledge at all? and it is not 
worth a nation&rsquo;s while that her children should now and 
again have practical experience of a higher state of things than 
the one <!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>they are accustomed to, and a few 
days&rsquo; rest and change of scene and air, even though she may
from time to time have to pay something in order to enable them 
to do so?&nbsp; There can be few books which do an 
averagely-educated Englishman so much good, as the glimpse of 
comfort which he gets by sleeping in a good bed in a 
well-appointed room does to an Italian peasant; such a glimpse 
gives him an idea of higher potentialities in connection with 
himself, and nerves him to exertions which he would not otherwise
make.&nbsp; On the whole, therefore, we concluded that if the 
British Museum reading-room was in good economy, Oropa was so 
also; at any rate, it seemed to be making a large number of very 
nice people quietly happy&mdash;and it is hard to say more than 
this in favour of any place or institution.</p>
<p>The idea of any sudden change is as repulsive to us as it will
be to the greater number of my readers; but if asked whether we 
thought our English universities would do most good in their 
present condition as places of so-called education, or if they 
were turned into Oropas, and all the educational part of the 
story totally suppressed, we inclined to think they would be more
popular and more useful in this latter capacity.&nbsp; We thought
also that Oxford and Cambridge were just the places, and 
contained all the appliances and endowments almost ready made for
constituting two splendid and truly imperial cities of 
recreation&mdash;universities in deed as well as in name.&nbsp; 
Nevertheless we should not venture to propose any further actual 
reform during the present generation than to carry the principle 
which is already admitted as regards the M.A. a degree a trifle 
further, and to make the B.A. degree a mere matter of lapse of 
time and fees&mdash;leaving the little go, and whatever 
corresponds to it at Oxford, <!-- page 320--><a 
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>as the 
final examination.&nbsp; This would be enough for the 
present.</p>
<p>There is another sanctuary about three hours&rsquo; walk over 
the mountain behind Oropa, at Andorno, and dedicated to St. 
John.&nbsp; We were prevented by the weather from visiting it, 
but understand that its objects are much the same as those of the
institution I have just described.&nbsp; I will now proceed to 
the third sanctuary for which the neighbourhood of Biella is 
renowned.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>At Graglia I was shown all over the rooms in which strangers 
are lodged, and found them not only comfortable but 
luxurious&mdash;decidedly more so than those of Oropa; there was 
the same cleanliness everywhere which I had noticed in the 
restaurant.&nbsp; As one stands at the windows or on the 
balconies and looks down to the tops of the chestnuts, and over 
these to the plains, one feels almost as if one could fly out of 
the window like a bird; for the slope of the hills is so rapid 
that one has a sense of being already suspended in mid-air.</p>
<p>I thought I observed a desire to attract English visitors in 
the pictures which I saw in the bedrooms.&nbsp; Thus there was 
&ldquo;A view of the Black-lead Mine in Cumberland,&rdquo; a 
coloured English print of the end of the last century or the 
beginning of this, after, I think, Loutherbourg, and in several 
rooms there were English engravings after Martin.&nbsp; The 
English will not, I think, regret if they yield to these 
attractions.&nbsp; They will find the air cool, shady walks, good
food, and reasonable prices.&nbsp; Their rooms will not be 
charged for, but they will do well to give the same as they would
have paid at a hotel.&nbsp; I saw in one room one of those 
flippant, frivolous, Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici matchboxes <!-- 
page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
321</span>on which there was a gaudily-coloured nymph in 
high-heeled boots and tights, smoking a cigarette.&nbsp; Feeling 
that I was in a sanctuary, I was a little surprised that such a 
matchbox should have been tolerated.&nbsp; I suppose it had been 
left behind by some guest.&nbsp; I should myself select a 
matchbox with the Nativity or the Flight into Egypt upon it, if I
were going to stay a week or so at Graglia.&nbsp; I do not think 
I can have looked surprised or scandalised, but the worthy 
official who was with me could just see that there was something 
on my mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you want a match?&rdquo; said he, 
immediately reaching me the box.&nbsp; I helped myself, and the 
matter dropped.</p>
<p>There were many fewer people at Graglia than at Oropa, and 
they were richer.&nbsp; I did not see any poor about, but I may 
have been there during a slack time.&nbsp; An impression was left
upon me, though I cannot say whether it was well or ill founded, 
as though there were a tacit understanding between the 
establishments at Oropa and Graglia that the one was to adapt 
itself to the poorer, and the other to the richer classes of 
society; and this not from any sordid motive, but from a 
recognition of the fact that any great amount of intermixture 
between the poor and the rich is not found satisfactory to either
one or the other.&nbsp; Any wide difference in fortune does 
practically amount to a specific difference, which renders the 
members of either species more or less suspicious of those of the
other, and seldom fertile <i>inter se</i>.&nbsp; The well-to-do 
working-man can help his poorer friends better than we can.&nbsp;
If an educated man has money to spare, he will apply it better in
helping poor educated people than those who are more strictly 
called the poor.&nbsp; As long as the world is progressing, wide 
class distinctions are inevitable; <!-- page 322--><a 
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>their 
discontinuance will be a sign that equilibrium has been 
reached.&nbsp; Then human civilisation will become as stationary 
as that of ants and bees.&nbsp; Some may say it will be very sad 
when this is so; others, that it will be a good thing; in truth, 
it is good either way, for progress and equilibrium have each of 
them advantages and disadvantages which make it impossible to 
assign superiority to either; but in both cases the good greatly 
overbalances the evil; for in both the great majority will be 
fairly well contented, and would hate to live under any other 
system.</p>
<p>Equilibrium, if it is ever reached, will be attained very 
slowly, and the importance of any change in a system depends 
entirely upon the rate at which it is made.&nbsp; No amount of 
change shocks&mdash;or, in other words, is important&mdash;if it 
is made sufficiently slowly, while hardly any change is too small
to shock if it is made suddenly.&nbsp; We may go down a ladder of
ten thousand feet in height if we do so step by step, while a 
sudden fall of six or seven feet may kill us.&nbsp; The 
importance, therefore, does not lie in the change, but in the 
abruptness of its introduction.&nbsp; Nothing is absolutely 
important or absolutely unimportant; absolutely good, or 
absolutely bad.</p>
<p>This is not what we like to contemplate.&nbsp; The instinct of
those whose religion and culture are on the surface only is to 
conceive that they have found, or can find, an absolute and 
eternal standard, about which they can be as earnest as they 
choose.&nbsp; They would have even the pains of hell eternal if 
they could.&nbsp; If there had been any means discoverable by 
which they could torment themselves beyond endurance, we may be 
sure they would long since have found it out; but fortunately 
there is a stronger power which bars them <!-- page 323--><a 
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>inexorably 
from their desire, and which has ensured that intolerable pain 
shall last only for a very little while.&nbsp; For either the 
circumstances or the sufferer will change after no long 
time.&nbsp; If the circumstances are intolerable, the sufferer 
dies: if they are not intolerable, he becomes accustomed to them,
and will cease to feel them grievously.&nbsp; No matter what the 
burden, there always has been, and always must be, a way for us 
also to escape.</p>
<h2><!-- page 324--><a name="page324"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 324</span>A PSALM OF MONTREAL.</h2>
<p>[The City of Montreal is one of the most rising and, in many 
respects, most agreeable on the American continent, but its 
inhabitants are as yet too busy with commerce to care greatly 
about the masterpieces of old Greek Art.&nbsp; A cast of one of 
these masterpieces&mdash;the finest of the several statues of 
Discoboli, or Quoit-throwers&mdash;was found by the present 
writer in the Montreal Museum of Natural History; it was, 
however, banished from public view, to a room where were all 
manner of skins, plants, snakes, insects, &amp;c., and in the 
middle of these, an old man, stuffing an owl.&nbsp; The 
dialogue&mdash;perhaps true, perhaps imaginary, perhaps a little 
of one and a little of the other&mdash;between the writer and 
this old man gave rise to the lines that follow.]</p>
<p>Stowed away in a Montreal lumber-room,<br />
The Discobolus standeth, and turneth his face to the wall;<br />
Dusty, cobweb-covered, maimed, and set at naught,<br />
Beauty crieth in an attic, and no man regardeth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; O Montreal!</p>
<p>Beautiful by night and day, beautiful in summer and winter,<br
/>
Whole or maimed, always and alike beautiful,&mdash;<br />
He preacheth gospel of grace to the skins of owls,<br />
And to one who seasoneth the skins of Canadian owls.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; O Montreal!</p>
<p>When I saw him, I was wroth, and I said, &ldquo;O 
Discobolus!<br />
Beautiful Discobolus, a Prince both among gods and men,<br />
What doest thou here, how camest thou here, Discobolus,<br />
Preaching gospel in vain to the skins of owls?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; O Montreal!</p>
<p><!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span>And I turned to the man of skins, and said unto him, 
&ldquo;Oh! thou man of skins,<br />
Wherefore hast thou done thus, to shame the beauty of the 
Discobolus?&rdquo;<br />
But the Lord had hardened the heart of the man of skins,<br />
And he answered, &ldquo;My brother-in-law is haberdasher to Mr. 
Spurgeon.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; O Montreal!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Discobolus is put here because he is 
vulgar,&mdash;<br />
He hath neither vest nor pants with which to cover his limbs;<br 
/>
I, sir, am a person of most respectable connections,&mdash;<br />
My brother-in-law is haberdasher to Mr. Spurgeon.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; O Montreal!</p>
<p>Then I said, &ldquo;O brother-in law to Mr. Spurgeon&rsquo;s 
haberdasher!<br />
Who seasonest also the skins of Canadian owls,<br />
Thou callest &lsquo;trousers&rsquo; &lsquo;pants,&rsquo; whereas 
I call them &lsquo;trousers,&rsquo;<br />
Therefore thou art in hell-fire, and may the Lord pity thee!<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; O Montreal!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preferrest thou the gospel of Montreal to the gospel of
Hellas,<br />
The gospel of thy connection with Mr. Spurgeon&rsquo;s 
haberdashery to the gospel of the Discobolus?&rdquo;<br />
Yet none the less blasphemed he beauty, saying, &ldquo;The 
Discobolus hath no gospel,&mdash;<br />
But my brother-in-law is haberdasher to Mr. Spurgeon.&rdquo;<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; O Montreal!</p>

there can be memory without a &ldquo;tolerably deliberate

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
